  <p>Singer-songwriter Mary <span word="Epworth" data-scaytid="4">Epworth</span> released her debut album, <strong>Dream Life</strong>, to great acclaim earlier this year, having been putting out singles since 2008. Displaying more of a bite than many of her more folk-based contemporaries to whom she&rsquo;s often compared, its mix of pop, rock and <span word="psychedelia" data-scaytid="8">psychedelia</span> has won her many fans and festival bookings alike.</p>
<p>Mary and her band played the Replay With Rob <span word="da" data-scaytid="10">da</span> Bank stage on the Friday lunchtime of this year&rsquo;s <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="9">Bestival</span>, and those who were sharp enough to catch her set were treated to an electric performance, featuring guitar, brass and autoharp (plus a member of the band seemingly dressed as a wizard). Urgent requests to load equipment as soon as the gig was finished meant Mary&rsquo;s planned interview with No Ripcord didn&rsquo;t happen on that Friday afternoon, so she caught up with Joe Rivers a few days later, when everyone was safely back on the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>So, how are you?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alright. I&rsquo;m applying for a couple of grants so I&rsquo;ve had my head deep in forms and things; they&rsquo;re <span word="PRS" data-scaytid="12">PRS</span> foundation grants. I&rsquo;ve had an Arts Council grant before to help record my album but I really want to write the next one so I thought I&rsquo;d apply to get some support.</p>
<p><strong>What are the criteria for getting one of these grants? How do you apply?</strong></p>
<p>It depends, really. <span word="PRS" data-scaytid="13">PRS</span> do a &lsquo;Women In Music&rsquo; one, so you have to have ovaries for that one! I don&rsquo;t know, I think they&rsquo;re trying to address the balance a bit.</p>
<p><strong>How do you go about writing? Can you talk me through the process?</strong></p>
<p>Usually, what happens is that I write when I&rsquo;m moved. I don&rsquo;t really see myself as a &lsquo;technical&rsquo; writer. If I&rsquo;m moved to write then a melody will come with some lyrics because I&rsquo;m feeling something. Then, if I&rsquo;m really lucky, the whole song will come, or perhaps a verse and chorus will come. I then have to go back and figure out what the first verse is about to write the second one! I have to work out the rhyme scheme; just fill in the blanks.</p>
<p><strong>Is it normally just you and an acoustic guitar?</strong></p>
<p>It used to be but I hardly ever play an acoustic now. Sometimes I write on autoharp but a lot of the time I write a cappella. I write into an 8-track and just sing it because that&rsquo;s the instrument I&rsquo;m most comfortable with and I can do anything with it, whereas guitar and other things I find more difficult. I&rsquo;m not a lead player on anything.</p>
<p><strong>I suppose the voice is much more instinctive as well.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, plus I can throw the chords together without knowing what you&rsquo;re doing is an augmented sixth or something like that which I perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play on guitar. Then I have to go back and anchor them onto an instrument.</p>
<p><strong>How&rsquo;s the second album shaping up? Is it in the writing stage now?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some ideas and some things which are half-formed that I think would work. What I didn&rsquo;t have with <strong>Dream Life</strong> at all was a period where I could just focus on that. The songs &ndash; some of them were quite old, some of them were quite new &ndash; didn&rsquo;t really come together. There&rsquo;s been all this stuff I&rsquo;ve been listening to since making that record, so I want to start afresh and think, &ldquo;Right, what do I actually want to do now?&rdquo; I feel that I&rsquo;m perceived in a way that I don&rsquo;t really see myself. I&rsquo;m seen by a lot of people as being folk or they think it&rsquo;s going to be acoustic or they think it&rsquo;s going to be nice-sounding. I think I&rsquo;ve shot myself in the foot with that because I&rsquo;ve said in the past that I&rsquo;m folk-rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a folk resurgence at the moment so there are worse things to be tagged with, but is it also related to the Sandy Denny tribute concert you did?</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the first things I did that got a bit of a profile. To be honest, the main thing is that&rsquo;s what my Wikipedia page shows. We send out a press release with the details of a record and you see that everything that&rsquo;s on there has been lifted from a Wikipedia page. I think you have to be careful what you put out there! It&rsquo;s getting harder to reinvent.</p>
<p><strong>So, going back to <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="15">Bestival</span>, how did you enjoy the festival and how did you enjoy your set?</strong></p>
<p>The set was good. It&rsquo;s always hard to tell but I don&rsquo;t think there was anything that made me come off stage and think, &ldquo;Oh God, we did this wrong and we did that wrong,&rdquo; which was quite nice. That probably means it was ok. I had to alter the set as we went along; we had to drop a couple of things or switch things because I felt the pace was maybe not right.</p>
<p><strong>You played very early on the Friday &ndash; is that more a challenge in terms of pacing things?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alright &ndash; I think you just have to do your gig and not think about that. We did the Friday at Hop Farm and opened the main stage which was really interesting; the headliner that night was Peter Gabriel. That was daunting because there were quite a lot of people watching, but not enough to fill the main stage area at Hop Farm at 12.30 on a Friday! So we&rsquo;re kind of used to that; it&rsquo;s a comfortable position now. In a way, you&rsquo;ve got nothing to prove when you&rsquo;re on that early. You just get on and do your gig and if the people want to see you, then great.</p>
<p><strong>And how about the rest of the festival?</strong></p>
<p>I stayed the whole weekend and definitely enjoyed it. It was a bit of a culture shock because it&rsquo;s a long time I&rsquo;ve been to a festival that big. We&rsquo;ve played a lot of them this year which are quite a lot smaller, so I hadn&rsquo;t quite steeled myself for the forty minute walk from the campsite. Plus, I was a bit shocked at how lairy some of it was. I&rsquo;ve got friends who go to <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="17">Bestival</span> every year and even they were surprised at how there was a bit of a different vibe this year. But I&rsquo;m pleased I got to see Stevie Wonder; I absolutely love Stevie Wonder, so that was just amazing. I was really gutted Frank Ocean cancelled though because I love <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong>. The day he was supposed to play, my friend in America emailed me saying, &ldquo;Hey, he was amazing on the VMAs tonight,&rdquo; and I thought, &ldquo;You stole our gig!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>I saw you mentioned on Twitter that you wanted to get your wildlife costume sorted but it didn&rsquo;t materialise.</strong></p>
<p>No, I completely failed at that, but I do spend all of my waking life obsessed with wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that on stage &ndash; did you see anything interesting?</strong></p>
<p>I saw a red squirrel, my first red squirrel in the wild, in the Ambient Forest. We went to End Of The Road a few weeks ago and I saw a hare on the site backstage there.&nbsp;But we definitely had fun there and it&rsquo;s always good hanging out with other bands.</p>
<p><strong>You made it back to civilisation okay after Bestival?</strong></p>
<p>It was fine. In fact, the biggest problem we had was getting into Bestival because somebody else had our wristbands! We turned up and they said to me, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Mary Epworth,&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;Well, Mary and her band are already here, so who are you guys?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How did that get sorted out?</strong></p>
<p>They gave us our wristbands but then we had to battle for our meal vouchers. Somebody turned up pretending to be my manager and blagged all of our passes, basically.</p>
<p><strong>So that&rsquo;s the way to get into festivals then?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think I might try it next year! It&rsquo;s pretty clever. I think it&rsquo;s amazing that people have the guts to go and do that stuff really; it really must take some planning. We were walking round looking for someone dressed as me with an artist wristband on so I could say to them, &ldquo;Are you Mary Epworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>I read that when you were younger you used to attend gypsy music workshops. Can you tell me a bit more about that and how it&rsquo;s influenced your writing?</strong></p>
<p>My Dad&rsquo;s a scientist and very open-minded, so he started going to them. It&rsquo;s working with the voice but it also has a very therapeutic aspect to it which is almost a bit addictive &ndash; you feel really good after going on one of these workshops because you&rsquo;re working in a really emotional way with song; it&rsquo;s quite cathartic. I first went with him when I was sixteen or seventeen. The first one I did was in the UK but then I went out to the Czech Republic and I&rsquo;ve since been out there loads doing workshops. They&rsquo;ve been a really big influence on me but not perhaps in the way you&rsquo;d expect. I&rsquo;m a really big fan of proper gypsy music which means I&rsquo;m a bit sceptical about pretend gypsy music. I&rsquo;m always a bit funny when white guys suddenly say, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a wild gypsy soul,&rdquo; because I think, &ldquo;Actually, you don&rsquo;t know anything about the culture&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s a bit like somebody blacking up. I really love that music but I don&rsquo;t think it massively influences my writing. I&rsquo;ve always been really into harmonies &ndash; the workshops teach harmonies a lot and sliding notes and things like that, so in a way I think I&rsquo;ve always done that. What&rsquo;s definitely come from there is more my approach to writing and performing which is that if you make it real, it&rsquo;s a much better experience &ndash; not only as a performer, but as an audience too. If somebody&rsquo;s on stage not really performing, just acting and not really thinking about it, it&rsquo;s different to when somebody&rsquo;s putting real feeling in it because that&rsquo;s a really affecting experience. I think that can work even if it&rsquo;s not the kind of music that you really like.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your album came out in June. How do you feel about how it&rsquo;s doing?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had loads of amazing press actually. When you&rsquo;re in the middle of it, it&rsquo;s easy to sit there and think that nothing&rsquo;s happening so I have to be constantly reminded by other people that there is stuff going on. But it&rsquo;s not been life-changing yet, put it that way. When you&rsquo;ve been working on it for that long and are so focused on just getting the album out, after it does come out, it&rsquo;s very much like, &ldquo;So now what?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m wondering at what point I&rsquo;m actually going to earn any kind of income from music.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re in the same boat as everyone else in that your album&rsquo;s on Spotify but money earned through Spotify is negligible.</strong></p>
<p>When [2009 single] <em>Black Doe</em> came out, I got &pound;20 from one day&rsquo;s worth of plays on Spotify which I was really amazed about because everyone says that Spotify&rsquo;s so bad. I don&rsquo;t know what to think about Spotify anymore because I&rsquo;d never heard of anybody earning any money from it. I think we got played on Radio 1 that night and then 5,000 people listened to it on Spotify in one day. But basically, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult and, to be honest, I&rsquo;m personally stretched to the limit in terms of what I can sell, what I can borrow from people, so at this stage I really need something to start happening where there&rsquo;s some kind of income rather than just outgoings otherwise I&rsquo;m going to have to start thinking very carefully about doing this. Unfortunately for me, I&rsquo;ve spent so long focusing on making music that I don&rsquo;t really know what else I&rsquo;m qualified for. I just think you have to be realistic and be really DIY about it. You can&rsquo;t waste money on things, you have to be smart about it and I haven&rsquo;t given up yet but at some points it&rsquo;s hard to sustain the enthusiasm for something especially when people are constantly congratulating me for how well I&rsquo;m doing. Every bit of press you get and every time you&rsquo;re visible, somebody thinks that means you&rsquo;re earning money. There&rsquo;s this disconnect between how you appear to be doing and how you&rsquo;re actually doing. There are a lot of artists out there and we&rsquo;re all perpetuating this myth. Whenever I say something like this on Twitter I get messages from other bands who look really professional saying things like, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got money to feed my children.&rdquo; I think we&rsquo;re all in that boat really.</p>
<p><strong>So, you&#39;re putting the new album together &ndash; is there anything else on the horizon for you?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this the impressive way &ndash; we&rsquo;re playing the Albert Hall! We&rsquo;re actually playing the Elgar Room at the Albert Hall but it always sounds much better the other way. That&rsquo;s on 20th October and should be fun &ndash; it&rsquo;s an amazing place to play. We&rsquo;re playing in Belfast on 1st November and we&rsquo;re doing Sound &amp; Vision, which is this amazing music industry event in Norwich. It&rsquo;s well worth going to, it&rsquo;s like SXSW except in Norwich! Other than that, I&rsquo;m looking forward to not having any gigs for a bit so I can concentrate on the next album.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it all winds down when festival season finishes.</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hopefully doing some Europe gigs in the new year, so it is winding down but we&rsquo;re also starting to plan forwards at the same time.</p>
