  <p>Walking through the <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="4">Bestival</span> campsite, looking for a spot to pitch my tent, I caught myself starting to smile. I&rsquo;d only spent a few minutes wandering around the site at that point but I had already <span word="recognised" data-scaytid="10">recognised</span> a lot from last year&rsquo;s festival, and the memories were flooding back. From the camping areas and the trails connecting one end of the site to the other, right down to the food and drink stalls; everything felt as it had done at <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="5">Bestival</span> 2012.</p>
<p>Indeed, much to my delight, I soon discovered that HMS <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="6">Bestival</span> 2013 had lost none of the unique charm that I had come to expect from my previous visit; it remained quirky and full of curiosities throughout. There were familiar sights such as the Swamp Shack, described by <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="7">Bestival</span> as a &ldquo;<em>ramshackle Louisiana bayou juke joint straight from the pages of a Southern Gothic fairytale</em>&rdquo; and new sights, including the Port, a full-size ship stationed at the top of a steep incline, complete with lasers, smoke screens and pyrotechnics from the funnels. There remained smaller areas that you could stumble across by chance, such as the Caravanserai, a small <span word="bric-a-brac" data-scaytid="14">bric-a-brac</span> camp built out of old vehicles, curiosities and <span word="objets" data-scaytid="15">objets</span> d&rsquo;art found on the road, as well as a record shop made out of cardboard and a giant inflatable model of Lionel Richie&rsquo;s head. Wherever you went, there was one constant - people were in infectiously high spirits.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there was the music.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be standing one row from the front barrier for Chic&rsquo;s set on the main stage; a set which, somewhat unexpectedly, turned out to be my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="16">favourite</span> of the weekend. Although I had little doubt that Chic&#39;s feel-good music would create a great atmosphere in the crowd, my knowledge of their repertoire was limited to their three or four most popular tracks and I was concerned that this would hamper my enjoyment of their set. As it turns out, Chic only performed a handful of their own songs. The remainder came from Nile Rodgers&rsquo; comprehensive back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="45">catalogue</span>, which was exploited to maximum effect over the course of the group&rsquo;s ninety minutes on stage. Featuring tracks made famous by a range of artists including Duran Duran, David Bowie, Madonna and, of course, Daft Punk, the set was full of surprises and had the crowd dancing and singing along throughout.</p>
<p>Another highlight came from Kate Boy, who performed early on Friday on the second stage, the Big Top arena. Their performance was proof that despite the volume of electro-pop released in recent years, the genre can still sound as fresh and exciting now as it ever has. Professional, confident and <span word="mesmerising" data-scaytid="22">mesmerising</span>, the group could easily have <span word="rivalled" data-scaytid="23">rivalled</span> the performances of most artists on the main stage and are a name to watch out for in the future.</p>
<p>My final musical highlight comes from James Blake, who performed to a packed-out Big Top arena late on Sunday night. What impressed me most about Blake&rsquo;s performance was how he was able to convert his intricate album recordings to a live audience. He played to a crowd of thousands, yet lost none of the intimacy of the recordings, supplementing haunting melodies with minimalist accompaniment and powerful, chest-pounding bass. After performances from Chic and Elton John on the main stage, Blake&rsquo;s music could easily have sounded downbeat and depressing, maybe even boring. But it didn&rsquo;t, and the fact that the tent remained full throughout his set is testimony to the strength of his performance.</p>
<p><span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="18">Bestival</span> balances the fun, quirky intimate nature of smaller festivals with the kind of music line-up that only major festivals can attract. It&rsquo;s a joy to experience, both for its music and for its eccentricities. In my <a href="bestival-2012-rob-da-bank-interview.html">interview with Rob <span word="da" data-scaytid="26">da</span> Bank last year</a>, he told me that &ldquo;<em>people know that as soon as they get on the ferry or come through the gates, they&#39;ll enter into a different world</em>&rdquo;. To me, the unique spirit of <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="27">Bestival</span> is now very clearly defined in my memory. It is a spirit of joy and adventure, of artistic excellence, fun and respect. And it&rsquo;s one that truly needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated.</p>
