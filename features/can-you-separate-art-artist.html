  <p>I faced my first <span word="epicurean" data-scaytid="1">epicurean</span> crisis when it was discovered that Woody Allen had been banging his girlfriend&#39;s daughter. &nbsp;As a teenager, I idolized Allen intensely, identifying with his neurotic Jewish pose and his simultaneous courting and ridicule of the intellectuals that littered New York in the <span word="70s" data-scaytid="2">70s</span> and <span word="80s" data-scaytid="3">80s</span>. &nbsp;I may not have known what a sensibility was, but Woody gave me one and by the time he started dabbling with Soon-Yi, it was too late for me to get a new one. &nbsp;So now what was I supposed to think? &nbsp;<strong>Manhattan</strong>, which centered around a forty-something man in love with a seventeen year old girl, was one of my favorite movies. &nbsp;The strangeness of Isaac Davis&#39; fascination with the young Tracy never occurred to me, such was the adeptness of the writing and the filmmaking. &nbsp;But now, it was hard to ignore the whiff of, well, you don&#39;t want to call it pedophilia, but creepiness gets pretty close. &nbsp;One couldn&#39;t help but reassess. &nbsp;Subsequent events have provided ample opportunity for second thoughts. &nbsp;Maybe we didn&#39;t need to revisit <strong>Towering Inferno</strong> in light of the O.J. Simpson trial, but Phil <span word="Spector&#039;s" data-scaytid="75">Spector&#39;s</span>&nbsp;&quot;amusing&quot; eccentricities, like pulling a gun on The <span word="Ramones" data-scaytid="81">Ramones</span>, became suddenly not so funny when he shot Lana Clarkson; and his legacy was nothing to laugh about. &nbsp;How was it even possible to start squirming when <em>Be My Baby</em> or <em>Then He Kissed Me</em> came on the radio? &nbsp;Here was music of such unadulterated joy and innocence that the idea it could come from the mind of a cold-blooded killer just doesn&#39;t compute. &nbsp;For that matter, how do you reckon <strong>Pet Sounds</strong> when Brian Wilson is so clearly bonkers? &nbsp;John Lennon wrote, <em>&quot;I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved&quot;</em>, and he wasn&#39;t kidding. &nbsp;From all accounts he was a shitty father, a lousy husband and an all-round cruel bastard when he wasn&#39;t shaking his mop-top with his buddies. &nbsp;Sure, he was a wit nonpareil and he could be a refreshingly honest truth-teller, if at that moment he wasn&#39;t lying through his teeth or inventing details his drug-addled brain couldn&#39;t possibly recall, but that doesn&#39;t excuse the way he treated Cynthia, Julian and most of the other important people in his life. &nbsp;But what does that tell you about the wistful perfection of <em>In My Life</em> or <em>Strawberry Fields Forever</em>?</p>
<p>For anyone serious enough about their passions, these contradictions inevitably have to be faced. &nbsp;It&#39;s a lot easier when you happen to be Jewish, because pretty much everything you read prior to 1930 is tinged with varying degrees of <span word="anti-semitism" data-scaytid="165">anti-semitism</span>. &nbsp;Shakespeare&#39;s depiction of Shylock is <span word="ambivalant" data-scaytid="189">ambivalant</span> in the extreme compared with some of the things that came out of <span word="Dostoyevsky" data-scaytid="184">Dostoyevsky</span>, Wagner or almost everyone else writing in the <span word="19th" data-scaytid="12">19th</span> century. &nbsp;But just this afternoon I listened to the prelude to <strong>Tristan and <span word="Isolde" data-scaytid="13">Isolde</span></strong> and soaked up every blissful second of it. &nbsp;In my opinion it pays to accept these absurdities, drop your natural defensiveness, and relax, otherwise you&#39;re likely to be consumed and blinded by your resentments. &nbsp;If you&#39;re going to get hung up by Mickey Sabbath&#39;s misogyny in Philip Roth&#39;s brilliant novel, <strong>Sabbath&#39;s Theater</strong>, and tell me how it&#39;s some reflection of the way way Roth treated Claire Bloom, I just don&#39;t know what to say to you. &nbsp;If anything, go complain about <strong>Deception</strong>, if only because that is the weaker book.</p>
<p>How typical. &nbsp;Here I am, a Jewish writer given the task of separating the art from the artist and all I can talk about is Woody Allen, Philip Roth and <span word="anti-semitism" data-scaytid="204">anti-semitism</span>. &nbsp;I&#39;ll up the ante by telling you that I just re-watched <strong>Passion of the Christ</strong> in an effort to determine whether I&#39;d been imagining Gibson&#39;s unflattering portrait of the Jews the first time I&#39;d seen it. &nbsp;I hadn&#39;t, but then again he was being somewhat true to his source. &nbsp;The problem is, the one-dimensional nature of the high priests and their <span word="cartoonishly" data-scaytid="223">cartoonishly</span> evil behavior detracts from an otherwise powerful, if <span word="unsettlingly" data-scaytid="22">unsettlingly</span> sadistic, film. &nbsp;It really is the art, not the artist, that should concern us. &nbsp;Gibson strikes me as at least a bit unstable, but I&#39;m more interested in what his films are saying and how they&#39;re saying it. &nbsp;The sadism in <strong>Passion </strong>seems to share an affinity with scenes of brutality and torture in the <strong>Lethal Weapon</strong> series, and I find it disturbing in both contexts. &nbsp;The idea that torture is some kind of path to enlightenment or vindication badly misses the point of the Gospels as well as the buddy cop movie.</p>
<p>Art is a form of communication, and just like when two people are talking, what really matters is what is being said and how they are saying it. &nbsp;We weren&#39;t given the ability to read minds, so all we have to go on is what is presented to us. &nbsp;Even a sociopath can learn to say, &quot;I love you&quot;, persuasively enough to be convincing, and the chemical rush of <span word="oxytocin" data-scaytid="229">oxytocin</span> coursing through the lover&#39;s veins is an experience not easily expunged from the memory. &nbsp;And that&#39;s a case where the lie is plain to see. &nbsp;But is <em>Be My Baby</em> or <em>In My Life</em> a lie? &nbsp;Maybe the flawed artist can still recognize truth and beauty when he sees it and capture its essence, even if he is unable to live up to its demands.</p>
