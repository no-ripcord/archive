  <p><em>&ldquo;At a time when most of the West was rocking out to guitar gods, something very different was brewing in Germany.&nbsp; Electronic music was virgin: neither tainted by the past, nor an Anglo-American import.&nbsp; And in 1968, it was being nurtured in Berlin.&nbsp; A city like no other.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; <strong><span word="Krautrock" data-scaytid="6">Krautrock</span>: The Rebirth of Germany</strong></p>
<p>Before World War II had ended, <span word="Hans-Joachim" data-scaytid="7">Hans-Joachim</span> <span word="Roedelius" data-scaytid="16">Roedelius</span>, one of the founding members of the seminal electronic group, Cluster, was <span word="Pimpfen" data-scaytid="10">Pimpfen</span>, which was the name given to the youngest members of the Hitler Youth.&nbsp; In the documentary film <strong><span word="Krautrock" data-scaytid="19">Krautrock</span>: The Rebirth of Germany</strong>, which details the development and eventual impact of <span word="Krautrock" data-scaytid="22">Krautrock</span> (or <span word="Kosmische" data-scaytid="25">Kosmische</span> <span word="Musik" data-scaytid="29">Musik</span>) as a cultural movement and musical genre, <span word="Roedelius" data-scaytid="27">Roedelius</span> explained, <em>&ldquo;They tried to make us soldiers, but fortunately the war ended in the right time.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; To understand Germany in the late <span word="1960s" data-scaytid="31">1960s</span>, <span word="Roedelius’s" data-scaytid="32">Roedelius&rsquo;s</span> story provides a lot of insight, his own experience providing context into the country&rsquo;s desire to undo its past and how this had inspired a generation of musicians and artists to find their voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with Boris <span word="Schaak" data-scaytid="35">Schaak</span> and musician Conrad <span word="Schnitzler" data-scaytid="36">Schnitzler</span>, <span word="Roedelius" data-scaytid="33">Roedelius</span> was co-owner of the <span word="Zodiak" data-scaytid="39">Zodiak</span> Free Arts Lab, a communal hang for artists and a venue for experimental music located in what was then West Berlin.&nbsp; It was within those walls that <span word="Roedelius" data-scaytid="34">Roedelius</span> formed Cluster with Dieter <span word="Moebius" data-scaytid="41">Moebius</span>, a partnership that bore an influential and ambitious body of work which is being reissued as a 9-album box set, <strong>Cluster 1971-1981</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cluster 1971-1981</strong>, as clear as its title states, documents the group&rsquo;s creative trajectory during its most prolific period.&nbsp; Cluster&rsquo;s original 8 releases are accompanied by an album of previously unreleased live recordings called, <strong><span word="Konzerte" data-scaytid="44">Konzerte</span> 1972/1977</strong>.&nbsp; Packaged with photos and essays, and available in both CD and LP formats, the importance of this music in correlation to so much of what has followed musically would be difficult to deny.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the ominous circuitry that courses through the length of <strong>Cluster &rsquo;71</strong>, (produced by <span word="Conny" data-scaytid="47">Conny</span> Plank who is credited as a band member), the group&rsquo;s first release, seems unimaginable for its time.&nbsp; And while the idea of working solely in electronic mediums wasn&rsquo;t necessarily new, (<span word="Karlheinz" data-scaytid="50">Karlheinz</span> <span word="Stockhausen" data-scaytid="53">Stockhausen</span> had been composing in electronic textures and tones as early as the <span word="1950s" data-scaytid="54">1950s</span>), <span word="soundscapes" data-scaytid="55">soundscapes</span> as troubling as these and perhaps <span word="unlistenable" data-scaytid="58">unlistenable</span> at the time of their release had to have been difficult to understand.&nbsp; The whole album sounds like aimless, <span word="comingling" data-scaytid="59">comingling</span> sonic frequencies, densely populating every available modicum of space.&nbsp; But, there&rsquo;s an intentional and almost orchestrated sense of dread involved that sounds too purposeful to be happenstance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By their second album, <strong>Cluster II</strong>, the environs hadn&rsquo;t changed much, though the inclusion of guitar melody in <em><span word="Im" data-scaytid="62">Im</span> <span word="Süden" data-scaytid="63">Süden</span></em> signals an attempted incorporation of conventional instrumentation.&nbsp; <em><span word="Für" data-scaytid="64">Für</span> die Katz</em>, which possesses an excellent antiquated science fiction quality to it, is rife with the sort of incidental noise one might find when viewing a black-n-white classic depicting the world of tomorrow through the gaze of hyper-optimistic wonder.&nbsp; And the melting waves of <em><span word="Georgel" data-scaytid="65">Georgel</span></em> take on an almost <span word="theremin-similar" data-scaytid="66">theremin-similar</span> quality, a queasy mix of tonal unease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1974 the group released a third album, <strong><span word="Zuckerzeit" data-scaytid="67">Zuckerzeit</span></strong>, which was co-produced by Michael <span word="Rother" data-scaytid="69">Rother</span> of <span word="Neu" data-scaytid="68">Neu</span>!, another forward-thinking and significant presence during <span word="Krautrock’s" data-scaytid="73">Krautrock&rsquo;s</span> creative ascendency.&nbsp; Acting also as a collaborator with <span word="Roedelius" data-scaytid="71">Roedelius</span> and <span word="Moebius" data-scaytid="72">Moebius</span> in the group <span word="Harmonia" data-scaytid="76">Harmonia</span>, (which had also featured ex-Roxy Music&rsquo;s Brian <span word="Eno" data-scaytid="77">Eno</span>), <span word="Rother’s" data-scaytid="78">Rother&rsquo;s</span> influence is heard as Cluster ponders melody, adding a clearer, more defined sense of instrumentation to their otherwise seemingly random fusion of layered sounds.&nbsp; And while this album sounds more compositionally sophisticated, there&rsquo;s no shortage of strangeness like <em>Rote <span word="Riki" data-scaytid="79">Riki</span></em> and the gurgling friction of <em>James</em>.&nbsp; Other tracks like <em>Caramel</em>, <em><span word="Fotchi" data-scaytid="80">Fotchi</span> Tong</em>, and <em>Marzipan </em>are aflutter with <span word="synth" data-scaytid="81">synth</span> melodies, aurally pleasant next to other more experimental moments on the LP.&nbsp; The same can be said for the group&rsquo;s follow-up, 1976&rsquo;s <strong>Sowiesoso</strong>, which explores melody to richer, more arranged ends.&nbsp; You hear this immediately in the album&rsquo;s title track, a delicate rhythmic jog in place as electric melodies follow each other throughout its expanse.</p>
<p>With <strong>Sowiesoso</strong>, Cluster&rsquo;s understanding of its own idiosyncratic tongue and how it could merge structurally with fluid arrangements seems to flourish.&nbsp; When you listen to <em>Halwa</em> and its gently rendered air of foreboding, the gorgeous emotional resonance of <em>Zum Wohl</em>, or the sensitive sway of <em>Es War Einmal</em>, it&rsquo;s difficult to trace this album back to the group&rsquo;s beginnings when Cluster&rsquo;s work meant more as a reaction against convention than manifest passion.</p>
<p>In 1977, through his involvement with Harmonia, Brian Eno began to collaborate with Cluster, which produced two albums: <strong>Cluster &amp; Eno</strong> and 1978&rsquo;s <strong>After the Heat</strong>.&nbsp; In the liner notes for <strong>Cluster &amp; Eno</strong>, the following is written: <em>&ldquo;The sparse instrumentation of Cluster &amp; Eno exudes calm, a series of tracks with no obvious beginning or end, centred on minimal shades of sound&mdash;Cluster in strict ascetic mode. Still, the presence of Eno is no less audible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Cluster &amp; Eno</strong> is an album of loops, a collection of cyclic sketches that don&rsquo;t sound fully explored.&nbsp; If anything, comparable to much of what Cluster had released before, especially <strong>Sowiesoso</strong>, <strong>Cluster &amp; Eno</strong> seems flat and careful.&nbsp; For Eno, however, this may have been a learning experience.&nbsp; In <strong>Krautrock: The Rebirth of German</strong>y, Moebius recalls, <em>&ldquo;Brian came to our house to learn from us.&nbsp; And, we didn&rsquo;t go to him to learn from him.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know what to do really, I think, in this moment.&nbsp; He was at the dead end of a street.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; Eno had already entered the ambient phase of his career by the time he&rsquo;d recorded with Cluster, but this experience had informed much of what he&rsquo;d contribute during the sessions that would birth <strong>Low</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Heroes,&rdquo;</strong> two of David Bowie&rsquo;s Berlin recordings from around the same period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its authorship attributed to &ldquo;Eno Moebius Roedelius&rdquo; respectively, <strong>After the Heat</strong> contains a better, more thought-out synthesis of the dual (or &quot;tripartite&quot; as the album is credited to three individual artists) personalities involved, as if this union had a better understanding of its parts and how each would factor into whatever musical happenings were to transpire.&nbsp; Eno&rsquo;s involvement was much more apparent this time around, his bass grooves running prominent in tracks like <em>Oil</em> and <em>Broken Head</em>, to which he also added vocals, which seem precursor to the bass thumps he would employ in his later collaboration with Talking Heads&rsquo; David Byrne for <strong>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</strong>.</p>
<p>And though Eno&rsquo;s expression had more weight this time around, Cluster&rsquo;s application of synthesizer melody and repetitious electronically-induced environs remain essential to the album&rsquo;s make-up.&nbsp; Fascinating and effective, the lightly wandering phrases that breathe through <em>Base &amp; Apex</em> and the melancholic and beautiful balladry at work in <em>The Shade</em> standout, not to mention the synthesizer riff that drives <em>The Belldog</em>, which, had Aphex Twin&rsquo;s Richard D. James had any creative intervention, could&rsquo;ve easily played backdrop to some 90s era trance number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Featuring the bass work of Can&rsquo;s Holger Czukay, <strong>After the Heat</strong> ends with <em>Tzima N&#39;Arki</em>, Eno&rsquo;s very distinct voice run backwards as he includes a chorus from his own song, <em>King&rsquo;s Lead Hat</em>, (an anagram of &ldquo;Talking Heads&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Tangerine Dream&rsquo;s Peter Baumann was approached for <strong>Grosses Wosser</strong>, Cluster&rsquo;s post-Eno follow-up.&nbsp; Released in 1979, Baumann shared producer credit with the group for <strong>Grosses Wosser</strong> and provided the studio, Paragon.&nbsp; Per the liner notes, <em>&ldquo;Peter Baumann had set aside plenty of time for the recording sessions, enabling Cluster to experiment with sequencers for the first time and explore some of the most up to date (for that period) studio gadgets on offer. Moebius and Roedelius made intelligent, measured use of the latest paraphernalia without being overwhelmed by it. New technology was deployed with an exactness designed to refine their (by this time&mdash;these recordings are from 1978) sophisticated and fully developed musical ideas.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For <strong>Grosses Wasser</strong>, the sound cultivated by Cluster is pursued with a more minimalist and, at times, abstract (even for them) bent.&nbsp; While the availability of new equipment at Baumann&rsquo;s studio certainly presented an array of untapped musical possibilities, it could&rsquo;ve been with an intuitive sense of how to proceed following the Eno collaborations that Cluster took a few steps back in order to progress, locating a new thoroughfare to travel down, investigating a different musical dialect unhindered by grand concepts, (though its epic title track could be perceived as such).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Its first track, <em>Avanti</em>, could arguably be viewed as an early template for how mid-80s horror films would be scored using synthesizer instrumentals, (a la John Carpenter), while tracks like <em>Prothese </em>and <em>Manchmal </em>are comparably snippet-length practice runs, one building off of relatively simple percussive theme that morphs into something oddly tense, the other a key melody dressed in electronic harmony.&nbsp; Atop a motorik movement of synthesized percussion, <em>Breitengrad</em>&rsquo;s acoustic piano strokes humanize its otherwise calculated stride.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the title track, its first act possesses some semblance of melody but only as it exists in the context of Cluster&rsquo;s non-musical ideas, which present themselves through cycling fields of heightened clicks and chimes.&nbsp; Before the second act, all you can register is the incessant clicking.&nbsp; Afterward, as if to offer homage to the percussive repetition of a group like Can, there&rsquo;s a persistence of ritual to the drum rhythms employed, the severity of which give way eventually to a rather beautiful arrangement of acoustic instruments that carry the track to its closing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>1981&rsquo;s <strong>Curiosum</strong> would be the last album from Cluster for almost a decade.&nbsp; Produced solely by Moebius and Roedelius, <strong>Curiosum</strong> plays like a half-serious cartoon, exaggeratedly atonal and mostly absurd.&nbsp; With its relentless bounce and spindly tones, <em>Proantipro</em> exemplifies the album&rsquo;s duality, which is its relatively humorless disposition being addressed via nonsensical sounds.&nbsp; A track like <em>Seltsame Gegendhas</em> the feel of an infestation, smaller, wiry bytes of synthesized sound seeming to crawl over each other, as if scaling walls or crowding the track&rsquo;s spatial design.&nbsp; And the inebriated pace of <em>Tristan in der Bar</em> is a stumbling blur, perhaps appropriate to the song&rsquo;s title.&nbsp; The very subtle final track, <em>Ufer</em>, makes use of light melodies and what sounds like ocean waves caressing the shores, somewhat of a fitting end to the studio portion of the box set and what was then an unintended beginning of a lengthy hiatus.</p>
<p>While the lasting effects and influence of Krautrock has persisted over the years, Germany&rsquo;s modernized outlook undeterred by the disparaging nomenclature with which it&rsquo;s been both blessed and cursed, the possibility that <strong>Cluster 1971-1981 </strong>will reintroduce Cluster&rsquo;s highly innovative and challenging work to new audiences of appreciators make this reissued set a worthy endeavor.&nbsp; Cluster fashioned a space of their own, their composed language and means of conveyance difficult to define even within the category this group had helped propagate, a necessary development that would not only compel musicians to think differently about their craft, but welcome a future of creative prosperity whose genesis owed more to enlightenment than the mere perpetuation of hippie-borne blues.</p>
