  <p>In the past twelve months, Nottingham&#39;s Jake <span word="Bugg" data-scaytid="4">Bugg</span> has achieved what most professional musicians would be happy to achieve in a whole career. &nbsp;As well as being signed to a major record label, he&#39;s supported such prestigious artists as Michael <span word="Kiwanuka" data-scaytid="1">Kiwanuka</span>, Lana Del Rey and Example,&nbsp;<span>appeared on&nbsp;</span><span word="BBC2" data-scaytid="7">BBC2</span><span>&nbsp;show <strong>Later... with&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span word="Jools" data-scaytid="8">Jools</span></strong><span><strong>&nbsp;Holland</strong> and has&nbsp;</span>had two songs selected as BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe&#39;s Record of the Week. &nbsp;All before the release of his <span word="début" data-scaytid="6">début</span> album and all whilst still just 18 years old. &nbsp;Clearly, this is an artist whose sound is connecting with a lot of people.</p>
<p>In spite of the whirlwind surrounding him, Jake comes across as remarkably grounded and mature, appearing to take it all in his stride. &nbsp;At the Bristol leg of 2012&#39;s Dot To Dot Festival, he took the time to talk to Craig Stevens about his career to date and plans for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Jake, welcome to Bristol. Have you played here before?</strong></p>
<p>No, I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve gone past it a few times though, seems like a nice place.</p>
<p><strong>You seem to have been playing all over the country recently, all over Europe in fact, working really hard and in support of Michael <span word="Kiwanuka" data-scaytid="10">Kiwanuka</span>. How have the past few months been?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s all been happening a bit fast. There&#39;s a lot to do but it&#39;s been very exciting and it&#39;s boosted my confidence loads. Especially in Europe, supporting Michael in those high-capacity venues on my own. It feels like I&#39;ve learned a lot in the last few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>When it&#39;s you on stage, is it literally just you on stage? Do you have anyone else in the band?</strong></p>
<p>I do now. When we did the tour in the UK, I brought the band with me, and it&#39;s bass and drums.</p>
<p><strong>But the technical side of it is you on the guitar. I mean, that&#39;s where the songs are written.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the songs are mine and the band just follow me, which is great. They&#39;re a really good little band.</p>
<p><strong>How do you go about writing songs? Where do you get your inspiration from?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t force it. If I sit down and think, &ldquo;I&#39;m going to write a song&rdquo;, I can&#39;t do it. I just try and let it flow. If I&#39;m twiddling on a guitar, I&#39;ll maybe come up with a melody and then put some words to it. Or if I&#39;m sat on a train, I&#39;ll put some words down and then add the melody to it later.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a prolific songwriter or do you go through spurts?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely spurts. Sometimes, it can seem like the easiest thing in the world to write a song. And at other times, it can seem like the hardest thing.</p>
<p><strong>What is it that usually <span word="kickstarts" data-scaytid="12">kickstarts</span> a song? Is it a riff, or do you get an idea of the sort of lyrics you want to write about?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s different with every song. I might come up with a nice chord structure, or just sing a melody round the house and try and put something to it. But I can&#39;t really say. When I like a song, I can&#39;t explain why I like it, I just do. Whether it&#39;s the riff, the chords, whatever &ndash; if I like it, I just go with it.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow, you&#39;re playing in your home town of Nottingham. Was Dot to Dot Festival something you were aware of growing up in Nottingham and have you been to it before?</strong></p>
<p>I actually played it last year, at The Bodega. And tomorrow (at Nottingham), they&#39;ve put me on the main stage, at Rock City. Nottingham&#39;s got a really good vibe, there&#39;s always a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p><strong>And will there be a lot of local fans coming along tomorrow? Have you got a lot of friends from school going?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I hope they come by &ndash; it would be nice to see some faces, especially at a hometown gig.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;ve released a few <span word="EPs" data-scaytid="13">EPs</span> now, when is the album coming?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s October now, they&#39;ve actually brought it forward. We were going to put another EP out. But because the album&#39;s been brought forward, we&#39;re going to put out another couple of singles out and then drop the album.</p>
<p><strong>The singles that have been released so far, are they going to be featured on the album or is it all new material?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they&#39;ll be featured on the album. I have got a bit of new material but I think that the singles I&#39;ve put out are probably stronger than the new material I&#39;ve got at the minute.</p>
<p><strong>Does the release of an album mean that we can expect a headline tour from you in the autumn?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there&#39;ll be one in November. There&#39;s already a London show at <span word="Scala" data-scaytid="14">Scala</span> in November, which I think sold about 300 tickets in the first week. It&#39;s quite shocking to hear that. I just hope it goes well.</p>
<p><strong>Not wishing to adhere to stereotypes, but a lot of people your age aren&#39;t really into the sort of music that you make. They&#39;re more interested in chart music, <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="15">dubstep</span>, or indie maybe. Your music is a lot more traditional. When you first started performing in school, did you get a lot of support and attention?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I played my first gig at school, and it&#39;s the scariest gig you can do. You&#39;re playing to the whole school and you&#39;re going to see those people every day for another five years. But no-one said a bad word, they were really nice. And it inspires you to carry on doing it. I&#39;m really thankful to the people that I went to school with.</p>
<p><strong>What are your long-term goals? Do you want to try and break the US or are you comfortable with doing what you&#39;re doing?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, of course I&#39;d like to break the US. It would be incredible to go over there and tour. But at the minute, I think I need to keep my head <span word="focussed" data-scaytid="16">focussed</span> on getting the album out over here first.</p>
<p><strong>And is there anything you can tell us about the album? Do you have any album titles in mind?</strong></p>
<p>I think it might just be called Jake <span word="Bugg" data-scaytid="17">Bugg</span>. I wouldn&#39;t probably go for an album title unless it stuck out. But I&#39;m not going to sit there and think about it for ages, because that&#39;s when it ends up being crap!</p>
<p><strong>We&#39;re currently on our way to the Louisiana to see Rae Morris. Are there any other acts you want to try and catch over the course of this weekend?</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;d like to try and catch Dog Is Dead and there are a couple of others. I haven&#39;t quite decided yet. But there seem to be quite a few good acts on.</p>
