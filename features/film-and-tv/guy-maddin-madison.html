  <p>On the evening of February 20, <span word="avant-garde" data-scaytid="1">avant-garde</span> writer-director-unabashed <span word="cinephile" data-scaytid="2">cinephile</span> Guy <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="3">Maddin</span> made a quiet entrance onto the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#39;s campus stage to elaborate on the theme of &quot;Loss in the Cinema,&quot; a fairly well-attended preliminary lecture at the <span word="Chazen" data-scaytid="4">Chazen</span> Museum of Art&#39;s <span word="Elvehjem" data-scaytid="5">Elvehjem</span> basement auditorium.&nbsp; The following afternoon, his surrealist celebration (or &quot;<span word="docu-fantasia" data-scaytid="6">docu-fantasia</span>,&quot; as he&#39;s described) of his home, <strong>My Winnipeg</strong> (2007), was presented in <span word="35mm" data-scaytid="10">35mm</span> at <span word="Vilas" data-scaytid="11">Vilas</span> Communication Hall as a precursor to an abridged analysis loosely originating from its &quot;Poetics of Memory, Space, and Architecture.&quot;</p>
<p>-----<br />Looking slightly disheveled but still poised and incredibly erudite, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="12">Maddin</span> began his Thursday talk by admiring the transitional state of the Midwestern winter weather between instances of hail and rain.&nbsp; &quot;Who knows what&#39;ll happen next,&quot; he prognosticated.&nbsp; Without a formal outline or traditional notes prepared, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="13">Maddin</span> amusingly revealed a handicap- that he was basing a portion of his talk from a series of sometimes-illegible abbreviations on <span word="notecards" data-scaytid="18">notecards</span>, but he really preferred to speak extemporaneously anyway.&nbsp; His honest delivery disclosed a self-deprecating humor that he later mocked further as &quot;self-defecating.&quot;&nbsp; Glancing into the empty space of the room, the acclaimed Canadian filmmaker seemed to perceive his own speech from a mirrored angle, which lent a humility and self-consciousness to the <span word="monologue" data-scaytid="19">monologue</span>, if tragically cut it short, shy of sixty minutes.</p>
<p>In order to properly frame the idea of loss in the cinema, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="14">Maddin</span> recounted his own memories and tales from childhood that have influenced his own filmmaking process.&nbsp; A tragic anecdote about his father&#39;s glass eye was as initially jilting as it was haunting; an unpinned broach on his grandmother&#39;s blouse poked his father&#39;s eye out in his infancy.&nbsp; Driven by a maddening guilt, <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="20">Maddin&#39;s</span> grandmother consequently poked out the eyes in every piece of photographic evidence displayed in their house.&nbsp; Whether the final bit of the story came out as earnest exaggeration, it made for a poignantly everlasting image.</p>
<p>Alluding to <span word="Derrida&#039;s" data-scaytid="21">Derrida&#39;s</span> <a href="http://www.howtothinkaboutthefuture.com/?p=75"><span word="hauntology" data-scaytid="22">hauntology</span></a> term (the present exists only with respect to the past), <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="23">Maddin</span> soon segued into the belief of film as a haunted medium, because it is an evolutionary branch of photography.&nbsp; From the instant a film is made, it recedes from the living actors in time.&nbsp; As part of his exploratory youth in digging through obscure and popular silent cinema, he noted how an eerie relationship can be established between the modern viewer and the silent stars who have since passed away.&nbsp; This continuing obsession led him to embark on this sprawling, time-consuming project to restore a part of history by remaking a hundred lost films from the time of cinema&#39;s origins.&nbsp; While not detailing much of this endeavor, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="24">Maddin</span> assured those in attendance that seventy of them have been shot (as of early 2014); but he did not disclose the number, if any, that have actually been completed.</p>
<p>Though he failed to illustrate a recurring cinematic contention at the summit, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="25">Maddin</span> returned to historical matters in the closing half to insist how context paired with loss are the &quot;two cylinders&quot; that propel the medium.&nbsp; This statement recalls the consistency of personal motivations for filmmaking and its construction and interpretation over the eras.&nbsp; <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="26">Maddin</span> detailed Soviet montage theorist Lev <span word="Kuleshov&#039;s" data-scaytid="33">Kuleshov&#39;s</span> initial experiment in the <span word="1920s" data-scaytid="34">1920s</span> in which <span word="Kuleshov" data-scaytid="35">Kuleshov</span> demonstrated that individual shots gain their power through arrangement and context.&nbsp; Recently, this has been applied by <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="27">Maddin</span> and his colleagues who have <span word="recontextualized" data-scaytid="36">recontextualized</span> plots from fragments of movies in order to create new meanings- &quot;a rolling mass of cinema&quot; of rousing possibilities.&nbsp; Experimental filmmaker Martin Arnold notably spliced <strong>The Invisible Ghost</strong> (1941) with pregnant pauses, which transformed <span word="Bela" data-scaytid="38">Bela</span> <span word="Lugosi&#039;s" data-scaytid="39">Lugosi&#39;s</span> acting performance into something less stylized through context, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="37">Maddin</span> observed.&nbsp; Arnold continued doctoring the film until it became a sort of comedic exercise of empty interior sets.</p>
<p>Resolving the contextual loss theme was a variation of the very concept that emerged in a Leo <span word="McCarey" data-scaytid="41">McCarey</span> film, <strong>My Son John</strong> (1952).&nbsp; Leading actor Robert Walker died of an lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs during its production, and <span word="McCarey" data-scaytid="42">McCarey</span> was forced to project images of Walker from Hitchcock&#39;s <strong>Strangers on a Train</strong> (1951) to complete the film.&nbsp; This immediately reminded me of the one example from my years of media explorations: Nancy <span word="Marchand" data-scaytid="44">Marchand</span> played Tony Soprano&#39;s mother <span word="Livia" data-scaytid="45">Livia</span> in <strong>The Sopranos</strong> (1999-2007), but she died before her character&#39;s motivations were resolved in season three of the legendary HBO series.&nbsp; Her final appearance was awkwardly created through use of existing footage and computer-generated imagery as a <span word="dialogue" data-scaytid="46">dialogue</span> with James <span word="Gandolfini" data-scaytid="47">Gandolfini</span> (coincidentally, who&#39;s now also passed), proving that the dead can be technologically resurrected as ghosts that continue haunt their respective productions.</p>
<p>-----<br /><strong>My Winnipeg</strong> began without an intervention or live narration from <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="48">Maddin</span> himself (<a href="http://twitchfilm.com/2007/10/guy-maddin-talks-up-my-winnipeg-self-mythologizing-pyschological-honesty-an.html">as he&#39;s done at prior film festivals</a>); he joined the crowd of a hundred-plus after the screening.&nbsp; Having no familiarity with the director&#39;s idiosyncratic style, <strong>My Winnipeg</strong> promptly introduced itself to me as something of a forbear and sister film to <strong>Stories We Tell</strong> (2012) by fellow Canadian filmmaker Sarah <span word="Polley" data-scaytid="51">Polley</span>, who recently uncovered her own history and identity through a recreation of familial memories with actors.&nbsp; There&#39;s less emphasis on place in <span word="Polley&#039;s" data-scaytid="52">Polley&#39;s</span> film, but <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="50">Maddin&#39;s</span> utter investment in his personal memories and dreams as well as the lore and actual history of &quot;snowy, sleepwalking Winnipeg&quot; shines brightly.&nbsp; Or at least as brightly as it can in one of the coldest, darkest cities in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p><span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="54">Maddin</span> narrates the film with a note of sarcasm in his intensely poetic and hypnotic language.&nbsp; Although it often feels scripted, in the post-screening talk he claimed that much of the narration was improvised in five-minute intervals, which lends the film a further <span word="daydreamy" data-scaytid="59">daydreamy</span>, enigmatic quality- that the presentation is somehow an oxymoron of prerecorded stream-of-consciousness.&nbsp; The first section cycles through more generalized observations, sounds, and images of Winnipeg before easing into a more specific scenario involving <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="55">Maddin</span> himself, a disembodied off-screen voice, subletting his old house at 800 Ellis Ave and hiring actors to play his mother, brothers, and sisters.&nbsp; In constructing and configuring the &quot;white. block. house.&quot; exactly as it was in 1963, <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="56">Maddin&#39;s</span> aim was multifaceted.&nbsp; He hoped to vivisect his own childhood, achieve some internal revelation to free himself of his family&#39;s power over him, and physically and psychologically disentangle himself from the forces of the town itself.</p>
<p>The mission statement paired with the director&#39;s unique sensibility create a wholly innovative sense that this semi-documentary of family life in the city is a <strong>Twilight Zone</strong> (1959-1964) episode, a fabled walking tour through an alternate timeline/reality.&nbsp; The use of stylized black-and-white photography magnifies this distinction and association.&nbsp; In lieu of <strong>The Twilight Zone</strong>&#39;s literal inclusion, a fictitious and equally absurdist television show called <strong><span word="Ledgeman" data-scaytid="61">Ledgeman</span></strong> makes an appearance.&nbsp; It immediately recalls the introduction of <strong>Seinfeld</strong> (1989-1998)&#39;s Newman character (originally voiced by Larry David) in season two&#39;s &quot;The Revenge,&quot; who repeatedly threatens to jump from the roof.&nbsp; In <strong><span word="Ledgeman" data-scaytid="62">Ledgeman</span></strong>&#39;s morbidly thin premise, however, a distraught man teeters on the ledge of a building after <span word="hyperbolizing" data-scaytid="64">hyperbolizing</span> a small incident into a crisis, and someone must talk him out of suicide in each and every episode.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most entertaining scenes in this amalgam of &quot;personal history, civic tragedy, and mystical hypothesizing&quot; concern the dramatizing of <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="65">Maddin&#39;s</span> own life.&nbsp; In a supposedly outdoor scene with an opaque backdrop that creates a surreal mood, <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="66">Maddin&#39;s</span> mother and sister argue about damage to the front end of a car that collided with a deer.&nbsp; In an hilarious bit of deduction, mother interprets the incident as a euphemism for what really interests her- not the accident but the sex act in the back seat.&nbsp; &quot;No lady stays out past ten with blood on her fender!&quot;&nbsp; The whole thing plays out like an absurdist comedy sketch, and the director&#39;s fixations only become more outrageous from this point on, detailing a hypothetical all-star ghost hockey team, The Black Tuesdays, as well as the Whittier Park fire where horses flee stables at a race track and freeze to death in the river.&nbsp; That grisly sight of the latter becomes an emblematic tourist attraction and lovers spot, as people flock to see the contorted horse heads sticking out of the frozen landscape like Gothic statues.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>My Winnipeg</strong> highlights the accessibility, distortion, application of memory.&nbsp; Although it is sometimes difficult to navigate the twisted paths in <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="69">Maddin&#39;s</span> imaginative version of Winnipeg&#39;s topography, his dismantling of the town is enthralling.&nbsp; The concluding sketch involving a <span word="superheroine" data-scaytid="76">superheroine</span> called Citizen Girl acting as a <span word="deux" data-scaytid="77">deux</span> ex <span word="machina" data-scaytid="78">machina</span> or goddess hand, undoing the damage that <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="71">Maddin</span> has documented and fabricated throughout, actually brings with it a sad finality in a creative project as haunting as the vanishing ghostly montage of images.&nbsp; His mother, the actress, and the actor who plays his deceased brother, lay together lovingly in an elegiac shot, as <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="72">Maddin</span> rhetorically asks, &quot;Who&#39;s alive anymore?&quot;</p>
<p>To anyone in the audience whose curiosities had been stirred by <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="70">Maddin&#39;s</span> idiosyncratic structuring, there was a resounding if silent answer to that in-film question: &quot;We are.&quot;&nbsp; As the director and University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty panel opened the discussion, <span word="Maddin" data-scaytid="73">Maddin</span> briefly mined his states of dreaming (in sleep and lucidly), likening them to a sort of hypnosis therapy where he was able to recall details better than in waking life.&nbsp; However, once <strong>My Winnipeg</strong>&#39;s production ended, he lost grasp of those detailed memories, &quot;curing&quot; himself much like the objective he literally states within the film&#39;s first half.&nbsp; While the supposed topic of discussion was the &quot;Poetics of Memory, Space, and Architecture,&quot; the conversation continued as a tangential analysis of material culture&#39;s collective sensory meanings- mainly, the house as a time capsule.&nbsp; Before all was said and done, I personally came to confirm what I had suspected all along through Guy <span word="Maddin&#039;s" data-scaytid="82">Maddin&#39;s</span> dual, complementary appearances- that art is therapy, and the film format has allowed him to fantastically digress and harness a distinct sense of restoration in the cinema and his own life.</p>
