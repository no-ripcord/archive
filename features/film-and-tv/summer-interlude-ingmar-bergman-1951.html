  <p>Filmed in Stockholm&rsquo;s outer archipelago, <em>Summer Interlude</em> [<em>Sommarlek</em>] (1951) is one of Ingmar Bergman&rsquo;s more overshadowed and elegiac early works that captures an emergent artistic master pushing toward a dark emotional integrity.&nbsp; The film also afforded him the opportunity of crafting a female lead that would later contribute to his reputation of as one of women&rsquo;s greatest male directors.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s also a coincidence, but the film opens with a naturalistic shot of a hillside and call of a cuckoo, a pairing nearly mimicked by friend and artistic colleague Andrei <span word="Tarkovsky" data-scaytid="1">Tarkovsky</span> in his feature-length debut, <em>Ivan&rsquo;s Childhood</em>.&nbsp; Both directors enthusiastically express dream imagery in the medium, and while <em>Summer Interlude</em> doesn&rsquo;t commence with a dream, the film itself houses a detailed memory and approximates the feeling with a visionary, idealistic quality.&nbsp; The style and themes found in Bergman&rsquo;s later work are notably apparent; even sans acclaimed collaborative cameraman Sven <span word="Nykvist" data-scaytid="3">Nykvist</span>, it exudes an empathic beauty of landscape contrasted with claustrophobic interiors in periods of solitude, pensiveness, and longing.&nbsp; Constructed in five acts with two lengthy contemplative flashback sequences, the film tracks twenty-eight-year-old prima ballerina Marie (<span word="Maj-Britt" data-scaytid="4">Maj-Britt</span> Nilsson)&rsquo;s summer vacation from thirteen years ago.&nbsp; A tale of first love unfurls with timid college student <span word="Henrik" data-scaytid="5">Henrik</span> (<span word="Birger" data-scaytid="6">Birger</span> <span word="Malmsten" data-scaytid="7">Malmsten</span>) that both peaked and ceased abruptly.&nbsp; Bergman intriguingly constructs the ensuing scenes through both poetic <span word="dialogue" data-scaytid="8">dialogue</span> and naturalistic splendor instead of commanding with one exclusively.&nbsp; The film successfully finds a balance of verbal and visual vocabulary; author of <em>The Passion of Ingmar Bergman</em>, Frank <span word="Gado" data-scaytid="9">Gado</span>, writes, &ldquo;Nor is any of the nineteen-forties films as &lsquo;literary&rsquo; in its symbolic weave, or as elegant in its dramatic construction.&rdquo; Even if the occasional blemish is accented &ndash; male characters of &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; <span word="Erland" data-scaytid="10">Erland</span> (Georg <span word="Funkquist" data-scaytid="11">Funkquist</span>) and Marie&rsquo;s present-day boyfriend David <span word="Nyström" data-scaytid="12">Nyström</span> (<span word="Alf" data-scaytid="13">Alf</span> <span word="Kjellin" data-scaytid="14">Kjellin</span>) feel somewhat neglected and underdeveloped in lieu of the leading romance, and the film&rsquo;s conclusion, possibly to complement its central tragedy, is sudden and truncated &ndash; <em>Summer Interlude</em> remains highly successful in presenting an engaging story of lost innocence.&nbsp; The film is further justified in Bergman&rsquo;s <span word="filmography" data-scaytid="15">filmography</span> by its origins as a short story he once wrote about his own brief but torrid teen love affair with a girl who later contracted polio as well as a former male friend.</p>
<p>From the onset, the grace of the ballet and poetry of introspection is immediate.&nbsp; Bergman&rsquo;s appreciation of the theater is given context in the production of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <em>Swan Lake</em> with a sequence during dress rehearsal; prior to the halt in the ballet production due to technical difficulties and Marie&rsquo;s reflective retreat, she shares the sensation of a recent dream, a prelude to the heart of the film, with fellow dancer <span word="Kaj" data-scaytid="20">Kaj</span> (<span word="Annalisa" data-scaytid="21">Annalisa</span> <span word="Ericson" data-scaytid="22">Ericson</span>).&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever had a dream at night and then woke up feeling so soft inside that you just wanted to cry?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon opening the pages of a black journal moments later, Marie&rsquo;s past rushes back and quickly transports her physically to the cabin where she spent a youthful summer at age fifteen.&nbsp; Throughout her recollections, her character is seen expressing mysterious, seemingly foretelling emotions openly.&nbsp; Even though they are articulately spoken, their precise meanings remain elusive to her.&nbsp; In fact, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook some of Marie&rsquo;s moody introductory <span word="narrations" data-scaytid="23">narrations</span> or a moment when she becomes frightened of the deathly portent of owl&rsquo;s call as opposed to the more tender affection for <span word="Henrik" data-scaytid="16">Henrik</span> or devoted attitude toward her aspiring career.&nbsp; These somber moments instill the film with an unusual depth; before the film facilitates her ultimate realization in present time, they are poignant constructs of the psyche on a therapeutic path to personal affirmation.&nbsp; A Bergman-connoisseur might argue that a certain indescribable chemistry exists between every one of his screenplays (this one co-written with Herbert <span word="Grevenius" data-scaytid="26">Grevenius</span>), images, and actors &ndash; his unique <span word="aesthetic" data-scaytid="27">aesthetic</span> penetrates and transcends the films&rsquo; respective decades, as is the case here.&nbsp; The relationship between Marie and <span word="Henrik" data-scaytid="17">Henrik</span> never seems unfamiliar or overwrought; the genuine character study surfaces from their own expressions of compassion, exhilaration, hopeful <span word="naiveté" data-scaytid="28">naiveté</span>, and doubt during the course of their short but spirited romance.&nbsp; In this film, distinctly, a short animated sequence by Rune <span word="Andréasson" data-scaytid="29">Andréasson</span> spontaneously appears on a record jacket to assist the two young lovers&rsquo; sentimentality and augments Marie&rsquo;s contemplative expression that they shared &ldquo;days filled with fun and caresses, (and) nights of waking dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the literal translation of the Swedish &lsquo;Sommarlek&rsquo; is &lsquo;Summer Game&rsquo; in the English language (sometimes written as a single word), the title attributed to Criterion&rsquo;s recent release substitutes the latter word with &lsquo;Interlude,&rsquo; a title that better &ldquo;conveys the transitory nature of the affair at the core of the film,&rdquo; as Swedish film scholar Peter <span word="Cowie" data-scaytid="30">Cowie</span> puts it in his <a href="http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2313-summer-interlude-love-and-death-in-the-swedish-summer">essay</a>, &ldquo;Love and Death in the Swedish Summer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This latter title preference also suggests a pensive pause rather than an exclusive emphasis on playfulness, thereby linking the film more closely to personal reflection.&nbsp; In the film&rsquo;s final acts, the tone grows colder, as the summer of thirteen years prior passes.&nbsp; Marie renounces her faith in God, carries herself in silence, and aided by family friend &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; <span word="Erland" data-scaytid="31">Erland</span>, attempts to shroud herself from misery by building a figurative protective wall around herself.&nbsp; Of course this final impractical suggestion from <span word="Erland" data-scaytid="32">Erland</span> proves to be an exploitation of a young woman&rsquo;s temporary fragility, and Marie&rsquo;s guilt and tragic sense of loss inevitably resurfaces, because she has suppressed negative emotions to the detriment of her emotional and psychological health.&nbsp; Detachment and regret are transferred onto Marie&rsquo;s strained relationship with reporter David <span word="Nyström" data-scaytid="33">Nyström</span>, who, along with her ballet master, attempts to rescue her from a forlorn state.&nbsp; Prior to her and David&rsquo;s reunion near the conclusion, the ballet instructor somewhat cruelly directs her to end self-pity to focus on the limited life of her performance art.&nbsp; As her metaphorical walls have crumbled due to the appearance of <span word="Henrik’s" data-scaytid="42">Henrik&rsquo;s</span> black journal from her youth, she is exposed as a bemused escapist.&nbsp; The film adheres closer to optimism and potentiality in its closing act, perhaps with greater urgency and lucidity with regard to Bergman&rsquo;s later introspective films.&nbsp; Frank <span word="Gado" data-scaytid="34">Gado</span> reasons Marie&rsquo;s eventual turn towards the future by writing, &ldquo;In choosing David... Marie is not just escaping from the &lsquo;artificiality&rsquo; of her existence; she also acknowledges her &lsquo;natural&rsquo; vulnerability &ndash; that mutability which is central to the summer theme.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often regarded as a modest landmark, <em>Summer Interlude</em> established Ingmar Bergman as a seminal international director of the <span word="1950s" data-scaytid="44">1950s</span>; it is an elegant template for his succeeding nostalgic summer films like the once-controversial and influential <em>Summer with Monika</em> (1953), and the ensemble-driven <em>Smiles of a Summer Night</em> (1955).&nbsp; In fact, he has said, &ldquo;(It) was my first film in which I felt I was functioning independently with a style of my own, making a film all my own with a particular appearance of its own, which no one could ape&hellip; It was all my own work.&rdquo;</p>
