  <p>They&rsquo;re cheeky scamps, those Radiohead lads, aren&rsquo;t they, eh? Thom and the boys thought they could catch us out with their cryptic Japanese tweets and bringing the album release date forward. But, here at No Ripcord, we&rsquo;re at the forefront and we know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>From now until Sunday, the writers of No Ripcord will be publishing their first responses to <strong>The King of Limbs</strong>, and this page will be regularly updated as the reviews and opinions come in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrew Baer weighs in with his two cents.</p>
<p><strong>The King of Limbs</strong> is perhaps Radiohead&#39;s most &quot;difficult&quot; release. With its skittering beats, lack of any conventional song structure and often ambient tone, no tracks jump out upon the first listen. The album as a whole, however, is slowly revealing itself to be greater than the sum of its parts. While it may have no standout single-oriented songs, they all work together in a way that makes it one of the band&#39;s more interesting records. What I began to notice under all the dense layers was how funky it all was. That&#39;s right: funky. Even the darker, brooding tracks have a strange, jittery dance quality to them. It&#39;s like nothing they&#39;ve done before, which in a roundabout way makes it sounds just like them. They&#39;ve done the expected in creating an unexpected album, but how is that a bad thing?&nbsp;</p>
<div>It offers less immediacy than<strong> In Rainbows</strong>, but at the same time it offers far more to pick apart. It&#39;s their most low-key, relaxing release yet, and given its length I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if more is on the way in the relatively near future. It&#39;s better to create an album that leaves the listener wanting more than disappointed with even a single moment, and they&#39;ve definitely done just that. I want more, and I want it soon.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/markrdavison">Mark Davison</a> was the first contributor to chip in with his thoughts on <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> on Friday lunchtime. He&#39;s now had more time to give the record a more considered listen.</p>
<p>After playing the album a through a decent pair of headphones rather than my computer speakers I feel like I&#39;ve given it a proper &#39;first listen&#39; (Radiohead&#39;s experiments with digital distribution may be exciting, but I&#39;m not sure that they&#39;re actually doing the listening experience many favours). The thing that struck me immediately during this play-through is how dense the record sounds &ndash; it may be short, but I think that it&#39;s going to be a while before I&#39;ve got to grips with the whole thing as there are so many layers to unpick. In particular <em>Feral </em>benefits immensely from the upgrade in speaker quality as before so many of the abstract cut &#39;n&#39; pasted layers were practically inaudible, and with no clear vocal line or hook it was difficult to pick out anything much to keep me interested. Now it&#39;s become the track that I&#39;m replaying the most, just to see what else I can find.</p>
<div>I don&#39;t think the lyrical depths are going to require as much work to uncover as I&#39;m not convinced that they&#39;re actually about very much at all. Which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; in my opinion Yorke&#39;s efforts to be more direct can have rather mixed results, in particular I found <em>Harry Patch</em> quite embarrassing &ndash; but then considering that at one of the few points where he&#39;s not mumbling he&#39;s raving at a magpie (and also taking into account his increasingly disheveled look) I&#39;m starting to think that if you took away the music and the delicate voice, there wouldn&#39;t be much separating him from the average tramp in your local park.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Having read through the opinions of the other No Ripcord contributors, I agree with Alan that Phil&#39;s either been replaced by a machine, or been made to play like he is one. It does sound terrific, but I do feel a bit sorry for the man. And although I suspect that Juan was being flippant with the EP remark I think he may have a point as well &ndash; I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if another announcement soon follows about another record, like <strong>Kid A</strong> and <strong>Amnesiac </strong>were to an extent &#39;sister&#39; albums, there may well be an equivalent for <strong>The King of Limbs</strong> waiting to be released (it would certainly explain why the album&#39;s so short).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/joe_rivers">Joe Rivers</a> downloaded the album Saturday afternoon. Here are his thoughts after one listen.</p>
<p>Radiohead records aren&rsquo;t exactly renowned for their immediacy, and it would appear <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> is similarly impenetrable on first hearing. Having played the album the whole way through, no one song stands out, but the most obvious talking point is the overall sound - they&rsquo;ve done it again. <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> takes elements from several other Radiohead albums (most notably <strong>Kid A</strong> and<strong> In Rainbows</strong>) but still ends up sounding like nothing they&rsquo;ve ever made before. It&rsquo;s probably their most dance-influenced record, but also possibly their least commercial. There&rsquo;s nothing here with a standard verse-chorus-verse structure, and it seems it&rsquo;s going to take careful consideration to really break through the layers. There&rsquo;s some great drumming, and the jittery, pulsing rhythms are wondrous but I&rsquo;ve currently no idea where it ranks against their other releases. Presently, it&rsquo;s more intriguing than outright enjoyable, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to living with <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> and writing a full review of it soon.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/wowlman">Joel Stanier</a>&nbsp;first heard&nbsp;<strong>The King of Limbs</strong> on Friday evening, and tweeted his thoughts track-by-track as he listened.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bloom </em>went over my head a bit, but [<em>Morning</em>]&nbsp;<em>Mr Magpie</em> is catchy. Love the afropop guitars and glitchy beats.</li>
<li><em>Little By Little</em> sounds kind of like a mashup of <strong>Hail To The Thief </strong>tracks with a new beat. S&#39;nice though.</li>
<li>Love the deep bass and wonky vocals in <em>Feral</em>.</li>
<li>First listened to <em>Lotus Flower</em> on the toilet at work. Wonder if anyone else had their pants down on first listen?</li>
<li>Nice chorus in <em>Lotus Flower</em>, but not sure the rest of the vocals do enough to complement the actual music.</li>
<li><em>Codex </em>is an anti-climax after reading comments today, but the outro is lovely. Suspect this one&#39;s a grower.</li>
<li><em>Give Up The Ghost</em> is pretty, but I reckon some kind of twist towards the end would have made it much better.</li>
<li><em>Seperator </em>also went over my head on first listen. Relistening to <em>Bloom </em>now tho, and it sounds much better now!</li>
<li>Album is good, but maybe needed a few more twists and turns. Suspect repeat listens will reveal a lot more tho.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>23:00 GMT: Alan Shulman on <strong>The King of Limbs</strong>:</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any obvious &ldquo;hits&rdquo; on this record, but really, did you expect there to be? &nbsp;It plays like a cross between <strong>In Rainbows</strong> and <strong>Eraser</strong>, if a frame of reference is required &ndash; heavy on the trip beats and languid moods. &nbsp;Yet, as always, Radiohead does not disappoint in the intrigue department.&nbsp; Like <strong>In Rainbows</strong> and most of their best work, this record casts a spell that is hard to resist. &nbsp;Being so short I would not be surprised if they recorded more material and left it aside to present a unified mood, which is resolutely downcast. &nbsp;I know, I know, that could describe any Radiohead record but it&rsquo;s especially true here, where, with it&rsquo;s similarity to <strong>Eraser</strong>, Yorke seems to dominate. &nbsp;Phil, where he is present, is made to sound more robotic and less expressive (see <em>Separator</em>), whereas Jonny makes his instrumental presence felt in subtle, rather than overt, ways. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve given us a lot to chew on in a relatively small space. &nbsp;The feast has just begun.</p>
<hr />
<p>It&#39;s 1530 GMT, and some other No Ripcord writers have been tweeting their thoughts over the past few hours...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/mmmbient">Jody White</a></p>
<p>Well Bloom is fucking LOVELY. I&#39;m really digging the new vibe!</p>
<p>Kind of like slipping into a beautiful daydream.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/juanerodriguez">Juan Edgardo Rodriguez</a></p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t Bloom sound like a page ripped off the Flying Lotus book?</p>
<p><span class="entry-content">Is this an EP? Tomorrow comes the real surprise, right?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/davenoripcord">David Coleman</a></p>
<p><span class="entry-content"><a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a>&nbsp;sounds pretty average through my PC&#39;s internal speaker. Will listen with headphones after my home visit...</span></p>
<p>A little underwhelmed so far?</p>
<p>Now that&#39;s more like it! Lotus Flower reminds me why I got excited about&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a>&nbsp;in the first place...</p>
<hr />
<p>First on the scene was <a href="https://twitter.com/markrdavison">Mark Davison</a>, who tweeted his reactions to his first listen to the album on a track-by-track basis.</p>
<p>11:21: I&#39;m not even a Radiohead fan and yet I&#39;m still excited to be listening to&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a>, they really do know how to launch an album.</p>
<p>11:41:&nbsp;1 song down 7 to go - I quite liked <em>Bloom</em>, mainly for the drums, but I can see some being a bit disappointed.&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>11:46:&nbsp;I think Thom was a bit drunk when singing <em>Morning Mr Magpie</em>, but I expect more people will like it than the first track.&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>11:52:&nbsp;Sounds like Thom carried on drinking thru track 3 as well. It&#39;s all sounding quite dark, introverted &amp; paranoid. But then it is Radiohead, so I shouldn&#39;t really have expected anything else.&nbsp;<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>11:53:&nbsp;Feral was a bit short and not that noticeable - not terrible though. 4 down, 4 to go&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>11:58:&nbsp;Lotus Flower&#39;s probably the most like a &#39;proper&#39; Radiohead (post Kid-A) song. Can see why they used that as the first video&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:02:&nbsp;Thought that Codex was pretty, but a bit ordinary, then the rather lovely horn section came in. 2 songs to go&nbsp;<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:06:&nbsp;Found the vocal sample on Give Up The Ghost irritating, bluesy acoustic guitar was interesting tho. Not sure about that one.<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:12:&nbsp;Separator definitely added up to something quite special when the various layers of guitar came together. Not really a big dramatic end to the album though.&nbsp;<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:13:&nbsp;So that&#39;s it. I think I enjoyed the excitement of the release more than the album. But then I&#39;m not a huge Radiohead-head.<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" rel="nofollow" title="#thekingoflimbs"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:14:&nbsp;It does sound quite sketchy &amp; low key, but then I find that the band can get a bit overbearing at times, so I don&#39;t have a problem with that&nbsp;<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingoflimbs" target="_blank">#thekingoflimbs</a></a></p>
<p>12:21:&nbsp;Correction, the things I enjoyed most about the album were the excitement of the release and the terrible Ian Curtis/Marcel Marceau dancing in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfOa1a8hYP8">this video</a>.</p>
