  <p>Hailing from the city of Buffalo, New York, <span word="Lemuria" data-scaytid="5">Lemuria</span> are a trio with a hard-working ethic that understands that the more you reach out the more they&rsquo;ll reach out to you. Their touring track record proves it &ndash; ever since founding members Alex <span word="Kerns" data-scaytid="6">Kerns</span> and Sheena <span word="Ozzella" data-scaytid="7">Ozzella</span> formed in 2004, they&rsquo;ve been gradually building a fervent <span word="fanbase" data-scaytid="8">fanbase</span> despite a flurry of lineup changes. They&rsquo;ve seen found stability in bassist Max <span word="Gregor" data-scaytid="9">Gregor</span>, an <span word="Austenite" data-scaytid="10">Austenite</span> who&rsquo;s been a member for the past three years. And the chemistry shows &ndash; their polyrhythmic approach to melody and stop-and-go dynamics couldn&rsquo;t be any more symmetrical, adding a layer of depth and energy to their live shows that&rsquo;s infectious.</p>
<p>While making the rounds promoting their latest release, <strong>The Distance Is So Big</strong>, they took some time to talk to Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="11">Edgardo</span> <span word="Rodríguez" data-scaytid="12">Rodríguez</span> at Downtown LA&rsquo;s <span word="FYF" data-scaytid="13">FYF</span> festival to discuss their thoughts on the influence of nineties music in today&rsquo;s context, the variety found in playing different kinds of festivals, and how their next record may potentially sound more like <span word="Sunn" data-scaytid="15">Sunn</span> O ))).</p>
<p><strong>How were you guys approached by <span word="FYF" data-scaytid="14">FYF</span>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max <span word="Gregor" data-scaytid="16">Gregor</span>:</strong> We&rsquo;ve known Sean [Carlson, founder of <span word="FYF" data-scaytid="23">FYF</span>] for quite a while, the guy who organizes it. I&rsquo;ve gone years past and always loved it so we always had a <span word="dialogue" data-scaytid="27">dialogue</span> going about, &ldquo;man, it would be awesome to play one year&rdquo;. And it finally lined up this year.</p>
<p><strong>The Distance is so Big has received much more attention compared to past records. Have you seen difference when playing these new songs live? Has the <span word="fanbase" data-scaytid="24">fanbase</span> increased?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex <span word="Kerns" data-scaytid="25">Kerns</span>:</strong> I would say so, yeah. We&rsquo;ve had a lot of people come up to us telling us how they just heard about the new album. A lot of people know a lot of the old stuff, and you have your old fans, but there&rsquo;s an influx of people that will come up and be like, &ldquo;Oh, play the new songs.&quot; And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh, awesome&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>The first song on the new record [Michael and Stephen Moon] threw me in for a loop. I thought it was going to sound like a <span word="Sunn" data-scaytid="30">Sunn</span> O ))) record.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh, yeah. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> Maybe next time.</p>
<p><strong>Something more <span word="droney" data-scaytid="32">droney</span>, You never know. So Magpie Cage produced the record, whose known for producing records by Jawbreaker and the Promise Ring. Did you see a connection in your songs when enlisting Cage, and do you think the new album has been unfairly getting comparisons to a lot of <span word="90s" data-scaytid="33">90s</span> music?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yeah, we do. Especially Jets to Brazil and Texas is the Reason. Bands that were in the cusp of punk and indie at the time, I think that&rsquo;s generally where we get thrown as far as being classified.</p>
<p><strong>Do you guys care if you get pigeonholed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex:</strong> I don&rsquo;t want to get pigeonholed.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> I never feel like we really are. There is an influence that comes from that direction and at this moment we&rsquo;re embracing it. Because, yeah, we just worked with J. Robbins, a very iconic figure in that community and that scene for that era. At this moment, we&rsquo;re just hamming it up, but I think that records of the past and the future aren&rsquo;t going to necessarily going to draw those connections quite as much as they do right now.</p>
<p><strong>With the nineties comparisons, I feel that that perspective is different because I feel that for people like myself, who are about to hit on their thirties, you relate to it. But now you&rsquo;ve got a lot of younger listeners and it&rsquo;s completely new to them. They&rsquo;re seeing something new and that&rsquo;s how it resonates to them.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> With all the comparisons to nineties music, there&rsquo;s a lot of aspects in the way that music was written and produced at the time that we relate to. A lot of the bands, specifically that were into, wrote and recorded music in a very organic way. I love getting comparisons to those elements are pulled out and compared to us, but by no means are we making nostalgic music. So I really hope that it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it.</p>
<p><strong>Is the band intent in staying as a trio for the time being?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yeah, we&rsquo;ve always been a three piece for about eight and a half years.</p>
<p><strong>But there have been some changes&hellip;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> This incarnation has been around for 3 years. It&rsquo;ll be 3 years in September 2nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Does playing at festivals feel like work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Not at all. Honestly, it&rsquo;s more so like, &ldquo;Oh cool, I get to play at a festival for free&quot; (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>What acts are you guys checking out tonight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex: </strong>I&rsquo;m excited to see the Breeders.</p>
<p><strong>Max: </strong>We just watched Metz and it was incredible. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to watch My Bloody Valentine, and were going to try to catch FLAG later on. I think it&rsquo;s going to be so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>Sheena Ozzella:</strong> I want to see the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. And Joyce Manor. But I&rsquo;m mostly just excited to wander around.</p>
<p><strong>Being from Buffalo, how do you compare FYF to other festivals in the East Coast? Are you playing other festivals this year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> We&rsquo;re playing another festival in a couple of weeks called Launch fest up in Sacramento. It&rsquo;s a similar booking to FYF. And we&rsquo;re also going to play Fun Fun Fest later on in my hometown of Austin. I really dig that whole style of festivals that are gaining popularity in the last few years. It&rsquo;s really eclectic, but still focused on indie more so than a lot of very single genre festivals. And while they&rsquo;re great festivals, with a lot of festivals it&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, I play this style of music.&rdquo; But the general trend with FYF is that it&rsquo;s a festival for music fans and that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s next in the agenda? Have you started working on new material?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alex: </strong>We haven&rsquo;t really started anything new because we&rsquo;ve been busy promoting the new album and touring a lot. So probably next year we&rsquo;ll start writing new songs.</p>
<p><strong>Max:</strong> We have plans for a 7 inch to come out next year. At least one, so we&rsquo;re going to have to do something for that.</p>
