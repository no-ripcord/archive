  <p>In the twelve months since being signed to Gilles Peterson&#39;s label, <span word="Brownshill" data-scaytid="14">Brownshill</span> Recordings, <span word="Ghostpoet" data-scaytid="7">Ghostpoet</span> (real name <span word="Obaro" data-scaytid="9">Obaro</span> <span word="Ejimiwe" data-scaytid="10">Ejimiwe</span>) has achieved more than some acts achieve in their whole career. &nbsp;His <span word="début" data-scaytid="15">début</span> album, <strong><em>Peanut Butter Blues &amp; Melancholy Jam&nbsp;</em></strong>earned him a nomination for the acclaimed Barclaycard Music Prize alongside artists such as Adele and Elbow. &nbsp;He&#39;s found a fan in Mike Skinner of the Streets, who was singing his praises before the album was even released, plus he&#39;s supported <span word="Metronomy" data-scaytid="17">Metronomy</span> and Jamie <span word="Woon" data-scaytid="21">Woon</span>&nbsp;on tour. &nbsp;Now, after a string of festival dates across Europe over the summer, he is about to embark on a tour of the UK and Australia.</p>
<p>Despite his busy schedule, <span word="Ghostpoet" data-scaytid="8">Ghostpoet</span> still found time for an interview with No Ripcord.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s almost a year to the day since you were signed to <span word="Brownswood" data-scaytid="11">Brownswood</span> Recordings and already you have a Mercury-nominated album. Can you put into words how the last twelve months have been for you?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#39;s been strange, really strange. In a good way, but I never expected any of this really. I knew I wanted to get an album out and I was fortunate enough to have <span word="Brownswood" data-scaytid="12">Brownswood</span> willing to take the risk and put an album out of mine; that&#39;s all I wanted to do. Other than that, it&#39;s just been a real rollercoaster. It&#39;s been a lot of luck and hard work, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>How did the record deal come about in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>It was literally through <span word="Brownswood" data-scaytid="13">Brownswood</span> checking my stuff out on <span word="Myspace" data-scaytid="22">Myspace</span> and through a friend of a friend. After that, I got asked to come down for a meeting; Gilles Peterson was there and we just spoke about music for a while, listened to some of my demos and he just said, &ldquo;Yeah, let&#39;s do an album, let&#39;s put an album out.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned <span word="Myspace" data-scaytid="23">Myspace</span> there. I know you&#39;ve said that <span word="Myspace" data-scaytid="24">Myspace</span> and other social networking sites have played a huge part in getting your music <span word="recognised" data-scaytid="25">recognised</span>. Is promotion through social networking sites what you&#39;d recommend to anyone who&#39;s looking to get a record deal?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best way to get a record deal but I think it&#39;s important to help make people aware of your music and your presence. And social networking&#39;s definitely the best way forward really, with the likes of Twitter and <span word="Soundcloud" data-scaytid="27">Soundcloud</span>. I think it&#39;s important to have your music up there. That&#39;s the way people want to listen to music now, and find out about music so it&#39;s important to be part of it.</p>
<p><strong>And you&#39;ve recently been added to the BBC Radio 1 playlist. That&#39;s an amazing achievement. Did you ever think your music would appeal to such a wide audience?</strong></p>
<p>No, not at all. I knew I wanted it to appeal to as many people as possible but I never imagined that happening. It&#39;s like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of musical influences, who were your influences growing up and which artists are you most feeling at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up, I guess it was all different styles of music. Just everything from hip hop to jungle and drum and bass. And then I got into <span word="electronica" data-scaytid="28">electronica</span> and grime. And everything I could get my hands on.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anyone you&#39;d like to collaborate with if you were given the chance?</strong></p>
<p>There isn&#39;t one particular person, just any artist who&#39;s interested in pushing things forward. &nbsp;Anyone who wants to create music that&#39;s not just experimental in nature but interesting too. &nbsp;A wide range of people, so that could be anybody, not just one particular person.</p>
<p><strong>It was announced back on 19 July that your <span word="début" data-scaytid="16">début</span> album, Peanut Butter Blues &amp; Melancholy Jam, had been nominated for this year&#39;s Mercury prize. The winner&#39;s finally announced next week [6th September]. How has the wait been?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s been alright. I can&#39;t believe it was 19 July, it&#39;s gone so quickly. Yeah, I was obviously really excited about it, as I still am. It was more kind of, the next day, just getting back onto doing what I was doing - gigging and making music and so on and so forth. It&#39;s only now that it&#39;s come back into the forefront of my mind. So yeah, I&#39;m looking forward to the day and to just having a good night really.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously, fantastic to be <span word="recognised" data-scaytid="26">recognised</span> by the Mercury panel but at the same time, do you think it adds pressure in terms of making what&#39;s already termed &ldquo;the difficult second album&rdquo;? Do you think it will change the way you&#39;re going to make music, push your music forward?</strong></p>
<p>No, it&#39;s not <span word="gonna" data-scaytid="30">gonna</span> change it. I&#39;m just going to continue doing what I&#39;m doing, which is making music. And trying to get it out of my mind and towards how I think the first album worked. Just having fun with it and making music that I want to listen to first and foremost. Yeah, but I can see how it can, I guess. But I don&#39;t think it will for me. I&#39;ll just keep doing the types of tunes I&#39;ve been doing really.</p>
<p><strong>Given you&#39;ve toured with <span word="Metronomy" data-scaytid="18">Metronomy</span>, there may be an obvious answer to this question but if you had to pick an artist other than yourself to win this year&#39;s prize, who would that be?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, it would be <span word="Metronomy" data-scaytid="19">Metronomy</span>, definitely. They&#39;ve been working really hard to get that album done. Any of the artists nominated could win it. But if I had to choose, I&#39;d say <span word="Metronomy" data-scaytid="20">Metronomy</span>.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;ve had an extremely busy summer with appearances at many festivals. Which has been the best festival for you?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed the Great Escape in Brighton, and Glastonbury was really good. I loved <span word="Sónar" data-scaytid="31">Sónar</span> in Barcelona, that was really good too. Other than <span word="that...all" data-scaytid="1">that...all</span> of them, in their own way, were great. The festival atmosphere&#39;s a unique one, you know? And I was lucky to partake in that many times this year.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;ve played a number of festivals and sets in countries outside the UK, including Sweden, Denmark and Lithuania. How has the reception been in those countries and does the language barrier create a problem when you&#39;re performing?</strong></p>
<p>The reception outside the UK was much better than I ever envisaged. Abroad, with the language barrier, I think - sometimes it can be an issue with crowds, especially with talking in between tracks. But what I&#39;ve been lucky to find is that the vibe of the music seems to translate well. People have been getting into the music. It doesn&#39;t matter that they don&#39;t understand any of the lyrics because they still have the vibe to latch on to. And that&#39;s been really good to see.</p>
<p><strong>Do you get chance to catch any other artists when you&#39;re at festivals and, if so, who&#39;s impressed you most this summer?</strong></p>
<p>Not all the time. But I did see Electric Wire Hustle, a New-Zealand based band at a festival in Belgium, they were really good. It&#39;s kind of like soul, funk, a bit of experimental <span word="electronica" data-scaytid="29">electronica</span>.</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;ve got a huge UK tour coming up at the end of September, including a massive <span word="Soundcrash" data-scaytid="32">Soundcrash</span> gig at London <span word="Scala" data-scaytid="33">Scala</span> on October 13. What can fans expect from the tour?</strong></p>
<p>Well, in terms of me and the band that are playing, our passion for music and us creating an experience that&#39;s different from others. It&#39;s going to be very much more experimental and the tracks are more interchangeable. Yeah, so people should come with an open mind and just enjoy themselves, that&#39;s the point of it.</p>
<p><strong>Finally then, what&#39;s next for you after the tour&#39;s finished? You&#39;re going to Australia for a few dates, but after that?</strong></p>
<p>After that, it&#39;s a case of putting out some more music, hopefully, more collaborations with people. And I&#39;ll start to work more extensively on my second EP or second album.</p>
