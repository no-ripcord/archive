  <p><em>Yoko Ono: &ldquo;Male <em>chauvinist pig engineer. (giggles) Yeah.&rdquo;</em><br />
John Lennon: &ldquo;Raht ahwn, sistah.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As if to stress himself fully as a preaching subversive willing to almost justify Nixon&rsquo;s paranoia, <strong>Some Time In New York City</strong> was John Lennon acting editor-in-chief to his underground news rag, the album&rsquo;s cover symbolizing the media&rsquo;s power as not only a source of factoids functioning as dietary supplements for the American social consciousness to chew on and consume, but also as an unauthorized wealth of activism and idealistic persuasion.&nbsp; On equal ground as collaborators, Lennon and Yoko Ono shared songwriting and performing duties along with the band Elephant&rsquo;s Memory, who were incorporated into the Plastic Ono fold for release.</p>
<p>As a megastar-turned-political liability, Lennon&rsquo;s cult of personality had already taken a step toward the avant-garde, Ono&rsquo;s established rep as an outsider artist allowed some oddity to seep into his songwriting approach.&nbsp; <em>Woman is the Nigger of the World</em> was after all based on an observation that Ono had come up with, and with it Lennon had an opportunity to unabashedly lambaste men&rsquo;s assertion that woman is, by and large, the weaker sex.&nbsp; Such potentially antagonistic and presumptuous claims, though, (so certain his claim that he states, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me take a look at the one you&rsquo;re with,&rdquo; as if to say ALL men are guilty of keeping women in roles of submission), stay fairly consistent within the grooves of <strong>Some Time In New York City</strong> and inject a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; positioning that&rsquo;s both preachy and self-righteous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, consider the album as an artifact, one born out of a turbulent political climate while Lennon himself had been targeted by governmental forces and threatened with deportation for basically speaking his mind.&nbsp; <strong>Some Time In New York City</strong>, inasmuch as Lennon bites his thumb at authority (<em>Attica State</em>) and colonization (<em>Sunday Bloody Sunday, Luck of the Irish</em>) and acts sympathetic name-dropper to activists (<em>John Sinclair, Angela</em>), as a newly transplanted New Yorker, he clearly reveled in the prospect of city life.&nbsp; <em>New York City</em> is relatively jovial, Lennon praising his new home and stating for the record: &ldquo;Well nobody came to bug us/Hustle us or shove us/So we decided to make it our home/If the Man wants to shove us out/We gonna jump and shout/The Statue of Liberty said &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ono&rsquo;s contributions, while at times abrasive, fit well enough with Lennon&rsquo;s penchant for melody, the girl group approach of <em>Sisters, O Sisters</em> is pleasant enough, philosophically positive and at least up beat.&nbsp; <em>Born In A Prison</em> follows the accusatory tone of <em>Attica State</em> with an easy-going disposition, though no less prone to point out truths with an air of superiority.&nbsp; Aside from <em>New York City</em>, Ono&rsquo;s <em>We&rsquo;re All Water</em> is one of the album&rsquo;s most unifying moments, people&rsquo;s similarities and the future we share bonding humanity to some degree and lessening the impact of our differences. &nbsp;Ono expounds through yelps and yowls a little too much at the song&rsquo;s extended climax, but at least the album ends on a hopeful note.</p>
<p>Accompanying <strong>Some Time In New York City</strong>, as if to further the album&rsquo;s already alienating position and sound, is a live album simply dubbed, <strong>Live Jam</strong>. The initial two tracks, (<em>Cold Turkey</em> and <em>Don&rsquo;t Worry Kyoko</em>), were recorded in 1969 at London&rsquo;s Lyceum Ballroom.&nbsp; The point, or points, of interest surrounding <strong>Live Jam</strong> is the set Lennon and Ono played with Frank Zappa and The Mothers in 1971.&nbsp; Zappa was in the midst of recording songs for what would be released as <strong>The Mothers: Fillmore East &mdash;&nbsp;June 1971</strong>.&nbsp; Music journalist and MTV mainstay, Kurt Loder, asked Zappa about the sessions in a Rolling Stone interview in 1988:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During our time onstage, a number of pieces were improvised, but a number of pieces that were played were absolutely written compositions that had already been on other albums &mdash; namely, a song of mine called <em>King Kong</em>.&nbsp; The deal that I made with John and Yoko was that we were both to have access to the tapes and could deploy them any way we wanted. They got a duplicate copy of the master, and they mixed it their way. I had a copy of the master, and I was gonna mix it and put it out as part of this Mothers album. They put out this record and took <em>King Kong</em> &mdash; which obviously has a tune, and a rhythm, and chord changes &mdash; and they called it <em>Jam Rag</em>, and accredited the writing and publishing to themselves. Take a look at the album. &ldquo;</p>
<p>With the Apple reissue, credit for <em>Jamrag</em> is still given to Lennon and Ono.&nbsp; Aside from <em>Jamrag</em>, the song <em>Scumbag</em> was mixed to omit Mothers&rsquo; singers Flo and Eddie, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Kaylan">Howard Kaylan</a> and Mark Volman), who were apparently having a laugh or two at Ono&rsquo;s expense, (Zappa: &ldquo;There&#39;s a reason for that. They&#39;re singing, &lsquo;Now Yoko&#39;s in the scumbag, we&#39;re putting Yoko in a scumbag.&rsquo;&quot;).&nbsp; The true mix of <em>Scumbag</em> was released in 1992 as part of a two-disc Zappa album entitled, <strong>Playground Psychotics</strong>.&nbsp; (Song titles were changed, mostly notably the very long and shrill <em>Au</em>, which was renamed <em>A Small Eternity With Yoko Ono</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Mind Games</strong> followed in 1973, Lennon breaking away from Phil Spector as his producer and keeping with the autobiographical/peace advocacy of <strong>Imagine</strong>.&nbsp; The title track itself was originally called <em>Make Love Not War</em>, and was based on an idea Lennon pulled from a book (Robert Masters and Jean Houston) that focused on world change through mental power: &ldquo;Keep on playing those mind games forever/Raising the spirit/Of peace and love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though still vocal about &ldquo;power to the people,&rdquo; <strong>Mind Games</strong> is not the Greenwich Village inspired radical manifesto that its predecessor was.&nbsp; Still threatened with the possibility of deportation, and apparently struggling with his marriage to Ono, Mind Games is mostly a stab at self-reflection, songs like <em>Aisumasen (I&#39;m Sorry)</em> and <em>I Know (I Know)</em> humbly apologetic while <em>One Day (At A Time), Out Of Blue</em> and <em>You Are Here</em> kept him connected to Ono.&nbsp; It was around this time that Lennon went on his 18 month bout of self-destruction known as his &quot;Lost Weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>The album itself is soft and ornate, at times almost contemporary like so many elder rock musicians become as their respective heydays pass them by.&nbsp; <em>Tight A$</em> and <em>Meat City</em> both push Lennon to enjoy his guitar a bit like a rock musician should and the overall positivity of <em>Mind Games</em>&rsquo; message seems to glaze most of the album even in spite of Lennon&rsquo;s introspection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His political bent is expressed with <em>Bring On The Lucie (Freda People)</em>, the four-second and silent <em>Nutopian International Anthem</em> (a place free of borders) and <em>Only People</em>, but none of these songs really deliver the vitriol he&rsquo;d up to this point been known for.&nbsp; <em>Bring On The Lucie (Freda People)</em>, in particular, plays like island music in spite of the song&rsquo;s issues with government, (&ldquo;So while you&rsquo;re jerking off each other/You better bear this thought in mind/Your time is up you better know it/But maybe you don&rsquo;t read the signs&rdquo;).&nbsp; <em>Only People</em> is like a show tune: accessible and snappy.&nbsp; Though not a complete retreat from his rep as a working class hero, <strong>Mind Games</strong> at least suggested that the political arena had lost its appeal to some extent.</p>
