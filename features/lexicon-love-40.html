  <p><em>&ldquo;Anyone who thinks pop music&rsquo;s easy should try to make a pop single and find out that it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo; - Robert Wyatt, 1996</em></p>
<p>Great. Pop. Music. Say those three words out loud and I guarantee your mind will be brimming with infectious melodies and vintage chorus lines. I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re an ardent noise fanatic or an image conscious hipster sneakily consuming &lsquo;guilty pleasures&rsquo; &ndash; you, my friend, <em>love</em> pop music. And <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> is up there with the very best of the art form.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s set the controls for my adopted home town of Sheffield in the heart of 1982. The city&#39;s synth-pop scene had already spawned two classic albums in 1981, The Human League&#39;s <strong>Dare</strong> and Heaven 17&#39;s <strong>Penthouse and Pavement</strong>. <strong>Dare</strong> was a commercial smash; its defining single <em>Don&#39;t You Want Me</em> went on to sell millions worldwide and was actually <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231" target="_blank">#1</a> in the UK singles chart at the time of my birth (yes, I&#39;m also 40).<strong> Penthouse</strong> was a relatively minor hit in comparison, although in subsequent years it would justifiably come to be considered a cult classic. But if 1981 belonged to Phil Oakey and his old charges, 1982 was the year of ABC and <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong>.</p>
<p>I first heard the music of ABC on an 80s compilation in my mid-teens. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the 1987 single <em>When Smokey Sings</em>, which is a decent enough song but very much of its time. I had no idea the group had produced a masterpiece of British pop just six years earlier, and would most likely have laughed in the face of anyone who suggested this was the case. It wasn&#39;t until I made the conscious decision to give <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> a proper listen 12 months ago that my opinion changed. Reading about <strong>Lexicon</strong> in Simon Reynolds&#39; excellent <em>Rip It Up and Start Again</em> book had ignited my curiosity and helped to place the record in context for me. I picked up a second hand copy of the LP and immersed myself in its riches.</p>
<p>ABC emerged from the ashes of synth-pop act Vice Versa. Martin Fry had been recruited as the band&#39;s synth player after interviewing them for his <em>Modern Drugs </em>fanzine; as Vice Versa inevitably fizzled out, the flamboyant Fry moved over to lead vocals and ABC was born.</p>
<p>The 1981 debut single <em>Tears Are Not Enough</em> highlighted a remarkable evolution, cracking the UK Top 20 with its shuffling white funk sound, but it wasn&#39;t until the arrival of 80s super-producer legend Trevor Horn and his future Art of Noise co-conspirators Anne Dudley, J.J. Jeczalik, and Gary Langan that things truly clicked into place for ABC. <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> captured this wonderful meeting of minds, as an ambitious young band with a clutch of great songs and a clear sense of concept received a zeitgeist-shaping production job. Horn would later apply the same treatment to lesser artists &ndash; the gimmicky Frankie Goes To Hollywood being his most famous example &ndash; and the overblown, dated results highlight the importance of the raw materials that ABC brought to the sessions. <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> is a wonderfully produced record and Dudley and Jeczalik&#39;s performances are integral, but to suggest it is a Trevor Horn/Art Of Noise record in all but name would be way off base.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s talk a little more about the songs and the all-important concept that unites them: love. Not the love of Hollywood, romantic fiction and teen-pop, but the miserable and unrequited love of recession hit South Yorkshire in the early 80s. <strong>Lexicon</strong> occupies a cynical world in which a sadistic Cupid fires off poisoned arrows and the battle-weary narrator Fry is doomed to repeat the love-heartbreak-regret cycle ad nauseam. It&#39;s like a twisted version of <em>Groundhog Day</em>, without the happy ending. Talking to <em>The Observer</em> in 2004, Fry reflected on the album&#39;s cohesiveness: &ldquo;When I listen to it now, it does have a consistency because it&#39;s all about the same thing: me ranting on about lost love.&rdquo; I couldn&#39;t have put it better myself, Martin.</p>
<p><strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> yielded four Top 20 UK singles, two of which &ndash; <em>The Look of Love (Part One)</em> and <em>Poison Arrow</em> &ndash; broke into the US top thirty. The other hits were edgy debut <em>Tears Are Not Enough</em> and polished ballad <em>All Of My Heart</em>. For me, the album&#39;s crowning glory &ndash; lyrically, conceptually and musically &ndash; is the disco-inspired <em>Poison Arrow</em>. Its power as a pop single has been diminished by overexposure and an unfortunate association with a million dreadful 80s compilations, yet in the context of the album &ndash; following on from the sublime <em>Show Me</em> rather than an awful Swing Out Sister track (shame on you, <strong>&#39;80s Dance Gold</strong>) &ndash; it remains as potent as ever. The synthetic funk bassline and the biting sarcasm of the chorus hook (&ldquo;Who broke my heart / You did, you did&rdquo;) are pure pop gold.</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty to enjoy beyond the chosen singles, too, as four or five of <strong>Lexicon</strong>&#39;s album tracks could have probably been top ten hits given the chance. Perhaps the most ambitious of these is <em>4 Ever 2 Gether</em>. Co-written by Anne Dudley, this is a moody dance-pop number, with orchestral flourishes and menacing stabs of synthesised noise. It&rsquo;s at the artier end of the pop spectrum, but the killer chorus helps to tie the whole thing together. Another personal favourite is <em>Show Me</em>, the album&rsquo;s stunning opener, which acts as both a signal of intent and a summary of <strong>Lexicon</strong>&rsquo;s charms. It begins boldly with a string overture, before a bright, rubbery bassline raises the tempo. Washes of synthesiser, sparkling guitar tones and a taut rhythm track offer a generous backdrop for Fry to demonstrate his vocal range, as he veers from smooth croon to eerie falsetto to the more theatrical yelps of the chorus.</p>
<p>If <em>Show Me</em> sees Fry announcing his arrival as a new, intelligent brand of pop star, <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> goes some way to supporting his bold claims. It&rsquo;s a wonderful album of lovingly crafted pop music, the like of which we&rsquo;ll probably never see again in this manufactured age of TV talent shows and Internet buzz. ABC were hard-working musicians with a depth of musical knowledge and a clear vision of what they wanted to achieve. Yes, they grew up with Bowie, Roxy Music and punk, but unlike the leading lights of the post-punk scene they had the courage to also embrace less fashionable styles such as disco and funk. <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> was the result of a unique fusion of influences in a specific city at a specific time. It&#39;s very much a one-off record and despite the efforts of countless imitators - and ABC themselves - no British pop act came close to even matching <strong>The Lexicon of Love</strong> in the 1980s.</p>
