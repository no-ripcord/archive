  <p>Earlier this month saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VLs1x-c3lw">the first taste of music</a> from former Australian Idol star Lisa Mitchell&#39;s third studio album, <strong>Warriors</strong>. &nbsp;Due for release in October in Australia, and elsewhere in 2017, the album was produced by the legendary Eric J <span word="Dubowsky" data-scaytid="2">Dubowsky</span>, a previous collaborator with artists such as The Chemical Brothers, Flume and Chet Faker. &nbsp;Lisa took some time out to talk to No Ripcord about his influence on her sound, also discussing her current music tastes, and touring Cornwall in winter...<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is lead single <em>The Boys</em> a good indication of the general mood and feel of your new album? &nbsp;The instrumentation certainly sounds different to that on your previous releases.</strong></p>
<p>Albums are so influenced by their producer, and <strong>Warriors</strong> is no different. &nbsp;I chose to work with Eric J <span word="Dubowsky" data-scaytid="4">Dubowsky</span> because I liked the idea of a contrast of our spheres, mine being these very personal private stories (the songs), mainly guitar or piano-based, and Eric&#39;s being his huge depth of experience in the studio, from being Rick Rubin&rsquo;s engineer to becoming a successful mix-engineer to now making a name for himself as an incredibly in-demand producer in his own right.</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide on the album title? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Warriors</strong> is also the name of one of the songs on the album, which was inspired by my growing-up in the country outside Melbourne, Australia. &nbsp;It is a study of the staunch independence and a clan-behavior of us &#39;country kids&#39; that being &#39;far away&#39; bred in us.</p>
<p><strong>How did Eric J <span word="Dubowsky" data-scaytid="6">Dubowsky</span> get involved with the project? </strong></p>
<p>Eric was introduced to me by my label, Warner. &nbsp;I did a day with him and worked on a song, <em>Love, Death X</em> which is on the album, and decided it was a good fit. &nbsp;There was a simple-ness to it, a &lsquo;<em>you&rsquo;re here, I&rsquo;m here, there&rsquo;s a vibe, lets go!</em>&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>All of your <span word="EPs" data-scaytid="8">EPs</span> and albums prior to <em>Warriors</em> have been produced by <span word="Dann" data-scaytid="9">Dann</span> Hume of Evermore. &nbsp;How did working with a different producer impact on your experience of creating this album compared to your previous works, did the process feel very different? </strong></p>
<p><span word="Dann" data-scaytid="10">Dann</span> Hume and I both made our first forays into our respective crafts with my first EP; his in production, mine in being an artist. &nbsp;Oddly though, it felt very natural to me that our season had ended, and it was time to open up to other worlds. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll work together again, though. &nbsp;In terms of the recording process with Eric, I really wanted to experiment with what it was like to be open to what he wanted to bring. &nbsp;I know that might sound like a given. &nbsp;But you must remember, I am bringing my own personal stories that maybe only 3 people have heard, into this new place and working with someone who I&rsquo;ve only just met. &nbsp;It is a total exercise in trust to not micro-manage an entire album process. &nbsp;But in letting go a bit, I found the real creativity started to bleed in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Earlier in the year, you did a winter mini-tour of Cornwall, UK with dates in three relatively small Cornish towns. &nbsp;It&#39;s fairly unusual for an international artist to tour small venues in Cornwall, especially in winter. &nbsp;How did the idea for the tour come about? </strong></p>
<p>It seemed that it was unusual for anyone to be in Cornwall in Winter. &nbsp;(laughs) &nbsp;No, the shows were sweet! &nbsp;<span word="Cosy" data-scaytid="12">Cosy</span> and good turn-outs, really worth doing. &nbsp;I took my little tape-player down with me as my &lsquo;drummer&rsquo; and acoustic guitar, so it was very relaxed and real. &nbsp;My boyfriend came with me so it was just the two of us on the road. &nbsp;At one venue it became very apparent after the first two songs that this bar was the local <span word="friday-night-get-pissed" data-scaytid="15">friday-night-get-pissed</span> place. &nbsp;I could see the people who had come to watch me straining to hear over the chaos (as I was!) and so I picked up my tape-player, told everyone who wanted to listen to follow me, and played the rest of my songs to two dozen people in the empty restaurant next door.</p>
<p><strong>Did you enjoy being out on the road again in Australia last week with GROUPLOVE? </strong></p>
<p><span>The <span word="GROUPLOVE" data-scaytid="19">GROUPLOVE</span> shows in Australia were really special. &nbsp;They are such open-hearted artists, and so their audience were similar; friendly, up-for-it and a really sweet crowd to open for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Often for artists, the next step after announcing an album release is to announce tour dates so...can we expect some tour dates before too long?? </strong></p>
<p>I actually just announced my Australian tour for October! &nbsp;Feels great to be working towards a show again. &nbsp;I am looking forward to coming over to the UK and US next year and spending some time over there with you lot too. ; )</p>
<p><strong>If you were to pick one place you&#39;d like to tour where you haven&#39;t already done so, where would that be? </strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to spend some time playing music in South America. &nbsp;Also, Hawaii&hellip; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s two...!</p>
<p><strong>And finally, which artists are you enjoying listening to at the moment? Is there anyone you&#39;d be interested in collaborating with in future?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment I am listening to BUOY&rsquo;s EP [<em><strong>Break</strong></em>] that just came out. &nbsp;She is magic, I really want her to support me in October in Australia...! &nbsp;<span word="Montaigne" data-scaytid="21">Montaigne</span>, another Sydney artist, just released an album [<em><strong>Glorious Heights</strong></em>], which I adore. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d love to collaborate with other artists in the future, not sure who yet&hellip; &nbsp;Perhaps an Indian singer&hellip; &nbsp;I am pretty into that world&hellip; &nbsp;I love Celtic music too, being half Scottish, so there&rsquo;s that world as well&hellip; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Our thanks to Lisa for taking the time to answer our questions. &nbsp;As mentioned at the top of this article, Lisa&#39;s album <strong>Warriors</strong> is due for release later in the year in Australia, and early next year in the UK and US. &nbsp;For details of her October 2016 Australian tour dates, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LisaMitchellMusic/app/308540029359/">her Facebook page</a>.</em></p>
