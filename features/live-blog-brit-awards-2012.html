  <p>Welcome to the Brits live-blog! First some housekeeping: you&#39;ll need to refresh this page (or hit <span word="F5" data-scaytid="1">F5</span>) at regular intervals, as we don&#39;t have any of that fancy auto-refresh software. Also, we&#39;d love to hear from you! Get involved using the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="2">Disqus</span> form at the bottom of the page, or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/noripcord">tweet us</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Conclusion: A bit of a non-event, sadly. Adele and Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="89">Sheeran</span> were the major winners and, surprisingly, Jessie J went home empty-handed. Adele, Rihanna and Bruno Mars gave good performances; the rest were terrible (Florence + The Machine), average (most of the others) or ruined many happy memories (Blur). British music&#39;s in fine fettle sales-wise, but it&#39;d be nice to have a few <span word="wildcards" data-scaytid="157">wildcards</span> to inject a bit of unpredictability and character into the mix (and not the irritating, look-at-me antics of Jessie J). It seems Adele&#39;s saving the biz all by herself so, in her inevitable absence over the next twelve months, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the British music industry copes.</p>
<p>2202: And we&#39;re done!</p>
<p>2201: WHY IS EVERYONE SHOUTING? I blame Florence Welch.</p>
<p>2200: Phil Daniels comes on for <span word="Parklife" data-scaytid="3">Parklife</span>. If you close your eyes, it&#39;s actually like the <span word="mid-90s" data-scaytid="4">mid-90s</span>&nbsp;all over again. I&#39;m expecting one of the Gallagher brothers to come onstage and do something &quot;controversial&quot;.</p>
<p>2158: Blur ripping through Song 2. Damon is genuinely awful vocally, really, it&#39;s painful to listen to. I&#39;m wincing with every &quot;<span word="Whoo-hoo" data-scaytid="5">Whoo-hoo</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>2157: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jwidnell/status/172076910325665793/photo/1">This </a>is what happens if you cut off Adele on live TV.</p>
<p>2156: Probably the least professional performance of the night. Not quite as bad the <span word="Cee" data-scaytid="6">Cee</span>&nbsp;Lo Green/<span word="Paloma" data-scaytid="7">Paloma</span>&nbsp;Faith car-wreck from last year, but not far off.</p>
<p>2155: Girls &amp; Boys was released 18 years ago. I feel very old. Damon&#39;s attempt at call and response is failing miserably.</p>
<p>2153: That really was sloppy. Anyway, Blur now doing Girls &amp; Boys. THIS HAD BETTER TURN INTO A <span word="MEGAMIX" data-scaytid="8">MEGAMIX</span>, YOU CURD-BOTHERING <span word="PILLOCK" data-scaytid="9">PILLOCK</span>.</p>
<p>2152: It&#39;s probably the least &quot;edgy music journalist&quot; thing to say ever, but doesn&#39;t Adele seem lovely? Wait, <span word="Corden&#039;s" data-scaytid="10">Corden&#39;s</span>&nbsp;cut her off mid speech to go to Blur! That&#39;s Damon&#39;s fault for his <span word="enormo-speech" data-scaytid="11">enormo-speech</span> earlier, that is.</p>
<p>2151: So, the final award, Best British Album, goes to... Adele! Have you heard of her? She&#39;s doing ok. Kylie&#39;s tipped her for big things.</p>
<p>2150: Hooray! George Michael&#39;s looking pretty well :-D</p>
<p>2149: Jessie J just said, &quot;without my fans, I wouldn&#39;t make music&quot;... Are you thinking the same thing as me?</p>
<p>2147: One more award to go. I make it 5/9 which I&#39;ve got right, so worst case scenario is that I end up with a 50/50 record (I knew that degree in <span word="maths" data-scaytid="12">maths</span> would come in handy one day).</p>
<p>2144: Is <span word="Corden&#039;s" data-scaytid="13">Corden&#39;s</span>&nbsp;insistence that the main award is the Best British Album one purely to make us think the ceremony&#39;s all really about the music. Because The Brits isn&#39;t really about the music at all, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s great.</p>
<p>2142: Blur have left the stage; Alex said nothing *relaxes*</p>
<p>2139: If Alex James likens winning the award to cheese in any way, I&#39;m going to smash my TV with my own face.</p>
<p>2138: LISA <span word="I&#039;ANSON" data-scaytid="15">I&#39;ANSON</span> ALERT! (again, one for the kids there)</p>
<p>2137: Ray &quot;<span word="Facking" data-scaytid="16">Facking</span>&quot; <span word="Winstone" data-scaytid="17">Winstone</span> is presenting Outstanding Contribution to Music to Blur. Now, advance warning to you all, because this means cheese-bothering, Chipping Norton <span word="wally" data-scaytid="18">wally</span> Alex James is about to appear on your TV screens.</p>
<p>2135: Even <span word="RiRi" data-scaytid="19">RiRi</span>&nbsp;didn&#39;t do a <span word="megamix" data-scaytid="20">megamix</span>&nbsp;this time round :( Nice of <span word="Corden" data-scaytid="21">Corden</span> to bookend it with a crap, misogynistic joke though.</p>
<p>2134: Rihanna&#39;s forgotten to put her trousers on - she&#39;s going to be SO embarrassed when she <span word="realises" data-scaytid="22">realises</span>&nbsp;(yes, there&#39;s a strong chance I made that joke last year too)</p>
<p>2133: Rihanna performing. Paint being chucked inside huge telephone booths; her dancers looking like they&#39;re having more fun than anyone else at the event.</p>
<p>2132: <span word="Labrinth" data-scaytid="23">Labrinth</span>&nbsp;just mistakenly wandered into shot... probably the best thing that&#39;s happened so far. He just can&#39;t find his way round the O2 can he, poor chap?</p>
<p>2131: <span word="LDR" data-scaytid="24">LDR</span> seems like the first person to be genuinely pleased and emotional to win... laying it on a bit thick though...</p>
<p>2130: Best International Breakthrough goes to... Lana Del Rey! Hang on, isn&#39;t the Brits based on sales up to the end of last year? Which would mean <span word="LDR" data-scaytid="25">LDR</span> has won this award on the strength of Video Games alone.</p>
<p>2129: I thought we were going to get through a whole awards show with no Black Eyed Peas, then will.i.am turned up :(</p>
<p>2127: To get through the remainder of the show, I will be <span word="freebasing" data-scaytid="27">freebasing</span>&nbsp;massive amounts of ILLEGAL DRUGS*! (*<span word="blackcurrant" data-scaytid="28">blackcurrant</span> <span word="Lemsip" data-scaytid="29">Lemsip</span> - other cold and flu placebos are available).</p>
<p>2125: Half an hour to go and still totally incident-free *sigh*</p>
<p>2123: <span word="Corden" data-scaytid="30">Corden</span> interviewing One Direction. They&#39;ve got that corporate, <span word="Syco" data-scaytid="32">Syco</span>&nbsp;answering style down to a tee. No trace of individuality or character at all - well done, lads.</p>
<p>2122: According to James <span word="Corden" data-scaytid="33">Corden</span>, &quot;in October 2011, Florence Welch released a musical masterpiece&quot;. Why is she promoting Ceremonials instead then, eh? (insert &quot;LOL&quot; here)</p>
<p>2121: Bruno Mars tailored his performance perfectly for primetime British TV there. Really good stuff</p>
<p>2119: <span word="Newsflash" data-scaytid="35">Newsflash</span>: This Bruno Mars performance is really pretty good. Expect a 100% increase in album sales for him come Sunday.</p>
<p>2117: Bruno Mars doing a slightly jazzed-up version of Just The Way You Are. He&#39;ll be good value for a <span word="megamix" data-scaytid="36">megamix</span>, right? <em>PLEASE?!</em></p>
<p>2115: Oh dear, <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="38">Sheeran</span> wins again, this time for British Breakthrough. Continuity announcer mentions his constant gigging to reach the top; it must be obligatory to point out how REAL HE IS. <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="39">Sheeran</span> thanks everyone sitting at home, which must include me. I don&#39;t want to really be part of this.</p>
<p>2114: Lest we forget, Nate Mendel of <span word="Foo" data-scaytid="40">Foo</span>&nbsp;<span word="Fighers" data-scaytid="42">Fighers</span>&nbsp;is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Mendel"><span word="AIDs-denying" data-scaytid="44"><span word="AIDs" data-scaytid="85">AIDs</span>-denying</span> <span word="headcase" data-scaytid="45">headcase</span></a>.</p>
<p>2112: Best International Group goes to... <span word="Foo" data-scaytid="41">Foo</span> <span word="Fighers" data-scaytid="43">Fighers</span>&nbsp;(or &quot;<span word="Fiders" data-scaytid="46">Fiders</span>&quot;, according to Queen&#39;s Roger Taylor). The <span word="Foos" data-scaytid="47">Foos</span> aren&#39;t there, so there&#39;s a video of Taylor Hawkins talking about the early days of the band, <span word="y&#039;know" data-scaytid="48">y&#39;know</span>, when he wasn&#39;t actually in the group and that.</p>
<p>2111: Brian May (presenting Best International Group) genuinely looks like he&#39;s wearing a judge&#39;s wig these days.</p>
<p>2110: <span word="Usain" data-scaytid="49">Usain</span> Bolt now on an advert. He was born on the EXACT SAME DAY as me. I&#39;d like to think he looks at my life, looks at his, and then feels a little disheartened at his relative lack of achievement.</p>
<p>2109: *yawns* Are Blur on yet?</p>
<p>2107: If you&#39;d like a reminder about the transient nature of fame, East 17 have launched their comeback (as a soft-rock, Kings of Leon-inspired band) today. Yikes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/popjustice"><span word="Popjustice" data-scaytid="50">Popjustice</span> </a>on Twitter:&nbsp;<span>I should warn you all I&#39;m going to be needing a medley pretty soon (&lt;--- I second this)</span></p>
<p>2104: I&#39;m pretty fed up of Rolling In The Deep now, so Lord knows what Adele thinks of it.</p>
<p>2103: I&#39;m not a huge fan of Adele, but she makes singing look pretty effortless. Like last year, she&#39;s a class apart from everyone else.</p>
<p>2102: Adele performance time!</p>
<p>2101: Kylie Minogue&#39;s tip for great current British act is... Adele. Going a bit left-field there, Kylie.</p>
<p>2059: Best British Group goes to... Coldplay! Who are those guys with Chris Martin? Oh, that&#39;s the rest of Coldplay - who knew?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2056: An apparently drunk Plan B presents Best British Male to... Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="51">Sheeran</span> (who&#39;s now wearing a suit). <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="52">Sheeran</span> appears to be as excited to win as if you&#39;d told him a <span word="lightbulb" data-scaytid="55">lightbulb</span> needed replacing.</p>
<p>2053: Paying full tribute to Amy Winehouse there... with a handful of black and white photographs.</p>
<p>2050: Performances have been a little flat so far this year. Everyone just playing it straight and doing their most famous song of the year. Disappointing.</p>
<p>2048: So, four awards in and I&#39;ve a 75% success rate. Expect to see me on the judging panel for the BBC Sound of 2013 in just ten short months...</p>
<p>2047: As my better half has pointed out, Noel seems to be closing his performance by segueing into <span word="KT" data-scaytid="57">KT</span> <span word="Tunstall&#039;s" data-scaytid="58">Tunstall&#39;s</span>&nbsp;&quot;Black Horse and the Cherry Tree&quot; (it&#39;s not quite enough to get a <span word="megamix" data-scaytid="56">megamix</span> klaxon, though I remain hopeful for later).</p>
<p>2045: Everyone - band, audience, Noel Gallagher himself - seems entirely indifferent to this performance. Noel&#39;s oddly expressionless too... and has very high cheekbones these days.. you don&#39;t think...?</p>
<p>2042: They&#39;re now talking about the Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="60">Sheeran</span>&nbsp;album, so I&#39;m going to tell you about the pancakes I had. I ate a couple of pancakes with venison sausage and cheese, which were lovely. Then I had a pancake with berries and sugar, which was also nice, and - oh wait, it&#39;s ok, he&#39;s gone now. We&#39;re onto <span word="Oasi-I" data-scaytid="62">Oasi-I</span> mean, Noel Gallagher&#39;s Angry Birds, or whatever they&#39;re called.</p>
<p>2039: Best International Female is... Rihanna! I&#39;m on a roll here. Only one wrong so far.</p>
<p>2038: <span word="1D" data-scaytid="63">1D</span> all dressed up smart, which makes them look like the nephews asked to sort out the parking at a wedding.</p>
<p>2037: The winner is... One Direction! Unfortunately it&#39;s past their bedtime, so, no wait! They&#39;re here!</p>
<p>2036: Best British single is being announced by <span word="Tinie" data-scaytid="64">Tinie</span> <span word="Tempah" data-scaytid="65">Tempah</span>. I wonder if <span word="Labrinth&#039;s" data-scaytid="66">Labrinth&#39;s</span> supposed to be with him and is stuck in the toilets like last year.</p>
<p>2033: Best musical moment so far as been <span word="Santigold&#039;s" data-scaytid="67">Santigold&#39;s</span> (<span word="née" data-scaytid="68">née</span> <span word="Santogold" data-scaytid="69">Santogold</span>) &quot;Say Aha&quot; playing in the advert breaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/Eamonn_Forde"><span word="Eamonn" data-scaytid="70">Eamonn</span> <span word="Forde" data-scaytid="71">Forde</span></a> on Twitter:&nbsp;<span>Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="72">Sheeran</span> = a <span word="Weetabix" data-scaytid="74">Weetabix</span> having a cry</span></p>
<p>2029: <span word="Sheeran&#039;s" data-scaytid="75">Sheeran&#39;s</span>&nbsp;properly killed the buzz here with his acoustic performance. He can add that to the list of things he&#39;s ruined. Incidentally, I&#39;ve found Ed <span word="Sheeran&#039;s" data-scaytid="76">Sheeran&#39;s</span> list of things he&#39;s ruined - would you like to see it?</p>
<div>Ed <span word="Sheeran&#039;s" data-scaytid="77">Sheeran&#39;s</span> List of Things He&#39;s Ruined</div>
<div>1) The Brits 2012</div>
<div>2) Absolutely EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD</div>
<p>2027: Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="79">Sheeran</span> performing now, with, <span word="y&#039;know" data-scaytid="80">y&#39;know</span>, a guitar because he&#39;s a PROPER musician who made it to the top completely BY HIMSELF (with major-label backing). As Popjustice.com once memorably said, he&#39;s like every friend-of-a-friend&#39;s band you&#39;ve been dragged to watch in a pub.</p>
<p>2026: Nice of The Brits to <span word="recognise" data-scaytid="83">recognise</span>&nbsp;<span word="Emeli" data-scaytid="84">Emeli</span> <span word="Sandé" data-scaytid="85">Sandé</span>, an up and coming artist who&#39;s only had one <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231" target="_blank">#1</a> single and one <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231" target="_blank">#1</a> album.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/guardianmusic">Guardian Music</a> on Twitter:&nbsp;<span><span word="Rizzle" data-scaytid="86">Rizzle</span> Kicks would totally be in Lisa Simpson&#39;s Non-Threatening Boys magazine</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/tracey_thorn">Tracey Thorn</a> on Twitter:&nbsp;<span>My two 14 <span word="yr" data-scaytid="87">yr</span> old girls have left the room. This is <span word="sposed" data-scaytid="88">sposed</span> to be for them, isn&#39;t it? This pop music?</span></p>
<p>2024: Just how young <em>are </em><span word="Rizzle" data-scaytid="90">Rizzle</span> Kicks, exactly? They look like they&#39;re on work experience (although I&#39;m sure they&#39;re still getting <span word="Jobseekers" data-scaytid="92">Jobseekers</span>&#39; Allowance, eh David Cameron? *satire face*)</p>
<p>2023: <span word="Olly" data-scaytid="95">Olly</span> <span word="Murs" data-scaytid="96">Murs</span>&#39; dancers all have skirts made from the final basket playing piece in Mouse Trap. Innovative.</p>
<p>2022: I think we just missed some sort of stage invasion there. Anyway, <span word="Olly" data-scaytid="99">Olly</span> <span word="Murs" data-scaytid="100">Murs</span> is on now, and is bravely attempting an <span word="avant-garde" data-scaytid="104">avant-garde</span> performance where he sings in a different key to the song.</p>
<p>2021: Bruno Mars looking an awful lot like Little Richard (one for the kids, there).</p>
<p>2020: Best International Male is... Bruno Mars. Oh well, my 100% record was nice while it lasted.</p>
<p>2018: Shot of Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="107">Sheeran</span> in the crowd - he&#39;s wearing a GREEN T-SHIRT. Make an effort, you scruff. Oh wait, sorry, that&#39;s &quot;authenticity&quot;.</p>
<p>2017: Best British Female is... Adele! Just like to point out now, I&#39;m on a 100% record (after one award).</p>
<p>2015: KYLIE MINOGUE! Just 13 minutes too late (see below).</p>

<p>2008: One good thing about this Florence + The Machine performance. At least she can&#39;t suddenly show up halfway through to do a guest spot. Though, if anyone could do a guest spot on their own performance...</p>
<p>2007: Dear Florence, shouting in tune is not the same as singing. Just so you know.</p>
<p>2006: How do you follow the strong voice of Whitney? Ah, with human foghorn Florence Welch, of course. Corks in ears time...</p>
<p>2005: WHITNEY HOUSTON MENTION KLAXON!</p>

<p>2002: Ways to improve this Coldplay performance: 1) <span word="Megamix" data-scaytid="114">Megamix</span>; 2) Kylie Minogue; 3) Put a <span word="donk" data-scaytid="115">donk</span> on it.</p>
<p>2000: The show opens with Coldplay, who are generally &quot;<span word="Coldplaying" data-scaytid="116">Coldplaying</span>&quot; around. Lights, lasers, and... well, a Coldplay song - what more is there to say?</p>
<p>1959: Here we go...!</p>

<p>1947: Happy Saint Pancake&#39;s Day! I&#39;m now completely full of sausage pancake (that&#39;s not a euphemism, by the way) and am ready for two hours of awards show fun! If you&#39;d like to know how this sort of thing normally goes down, here&#39;s a link to <a href="live-blog-brit-awards-2011.html">last year&#39;s event</a>. Your contributions make the evening what it is, so please get involved using either the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="126">Disqus</span> form below, or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/noripcord">tweet us</a>.</p>
