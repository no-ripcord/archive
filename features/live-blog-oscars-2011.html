  <p><strong>*Closes the red curtain*</strong></p>
<p>12:45 To all those who stayed up, I bid farewell and good night. Hope this was a tolerable experience for the five, or four, &nbsp;or, yep, three, no, two who tuned in. To finalize, a curious No Ripcord fact: I&#39;ve never written a film review for this site, yet I can&#39;t disallow my love for the movies. That&#39;s&nbsp;because I generally dislike writing film criticism - perhaps because I write films myself? Anyhow, this has been fun. Well, I&#39;m off to lounge with the stars with my No Ripcord press pass, em, not. To those exclusively interested in the music side of things, I&#39;ll be writing and publishing a review of the new&nbsp;Papercuts&nbsp;album tomorrow. Adieu!</p>
<p>12:41 Final tally: 14/21. Considering my second choices (and refusal to listen to my gut instinct), I would&#39;ve easily gotten eighteen right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>12:39 Final thought: No musical numbers made by Franco and Hathaway? A shocker - maybe it would&#39;ve brightened things up a bit.</p>
<p>12:36 And the Best Picture Oscar goes to....The King&#39;s Speech. All that word of mouth paid off, but it only won four awards? Not exactly a sweeping victory. Weinstein must be gloating: this goes back to the glory days of Shakespeare in Love, English Patient, etc. In my humble opinion, the Social Network will age much better - or it will eternally be regarded as that Facebook movie.</p>
<p>12:31 Final Oscars fun fact: The most Oscars to any film that didn&#39;t also win Best Picture: 8 wins for Cabaret in 1972. It was the year in which the Godfather won.</p>
<p>12:29 We&#39;ve just hit the three hour mark. This year, the Oscars have been cosideraly&nbsp;shorter, but doubly more dull. Is Spielberg presenting Best Picture again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>12:25 Colin Firth wins. Highly expected. But still, I&#39;m really happy for him - an actor of great caliber finally gets his due. And I win as well: 14/20.</p>
<p>12:22 Jesse Eisenberg spotlight. Indie moment of the night. Thoughts of the music in Adventureland&nbsp;pop into my consciousness. Feel like cranking some Husker Du, but it&#39;s 12:23.</p>
<p>12:15 Best Actress: Natalie Portman did well enough, but her performance is not winning material. Maybe I&#39;m prejudiced because I thought The Black Swan was grossly overrated? Either way, 13/19. Make a gratuitous&nbsp;lesbo scene, you&#39;re guaranteed winning results. She looks poised - I wanted a crying fest. Are these actors on Zoloft? Disappointing.</p>
<p>12:11 I just X&#39;ed the Huffington Post live blog because it was downright idiotic. Substituting Oscars fun fact for bathroom break.</p>
<p>12:06 The Oscars are beginning to drag. Move along, will ya? Sofia Coppola suddenly comes into frame; she has pretty big teeth.</p>
<p>12:03 Two and a half hours in, I&#39;m starting to blow fumes. And the Best Director goes to...Tom Hooper for the King&#39;s Speech. My gut had him to win, but I went with David Fincher. Really thought they&#39;d give it to him. Tom gives the most heartfelt speech of the night. 12/18</p>
<p>11:58 Halle Berry homages Lena Horne. It was quite lovely. Though she pays respect to her for being a African-American woman, she probably didn&#39;t know who she was until this past weekend. Tribute ends with the following quote: &quot;It&#39;s not the load that gets you down, it&#39;s the way you carry it.&quot; Well said.</p>
<p>11:53 What?!!!!! Celine Dion???? NOOOOOOO!!!&nbsp;Is this the big surprise of the night? Totally unexpected, yet totally unwanted.</p>
<p>11:48 Randy Newman wins; the sport makes joke about himself. Sort of makes me respect the man. Although, he doesn&#39;t shut up already...and there&#39;s still no orchestral cue. I told you his win was fixed. 12/17.</p>
<p>11:45 Since nobody cares about Gwyneth&nbsp;Paltrow&#39;s&nbsp;flat voice, here Oscars fun fact <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%235" target="_blank">#5</a>: &nbsp;The shortest film to win best picture was Marty in 1955, clocking in at 91 minutes. Annie Hall inches close - that one lasts 93 minutes.</p>
<p>11:41 James Franco tells dick jokes; I check my watch. *shrug*</p>
<p>11:35 The Social Network deservedly wins Best Editing. All those expertly handled spliced shots are pretty much what MAKE the film. 11/16 Oh, and Jude Law&#39;s makeup is freakishly similar to his robotic mien on&nbsp;A.I.</p>
<p>11:32 I&#39;m always a sucker for these Oscar retrospectives. Bob Hope hosting the Oscars. Visual Effects= another expected win for Inception. 10/15 Is this an &quot;inception&quot; of things to come? Second bad joke of the night.</p>
<p>11:23 Best Documentary: no Bansky&nbsp;win, but I did! 9/14. The director (Joshua Kors) makes a good point - thankfully, it wasn&#39;t an elongated speech; kept it short and didn&#39;t make a statement. But then again, it was yet another unremarkable speech.</p>
<p>11:18 Am I actually listening to an auto-tune interpretation of Oscar nominees? I must be drunk already. But wait, it&#39;s actually for real: excuse me while I go to the toilet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11:16 Almost two hours in, now my dad fell asleep. The moment everyone is waiting for gets closer: will Exit through the gift shop win, and will Bansky&nbsp;make an appearance?</p>
<p>11:10 Commercial time. Oscars fun fact time. Here&#39;s number 4: You must be wondering who&#39;s won the most Best Actor statuettes. Walter Brennan (all Best Supporting Actor) and Jack Nicholson (1 Best Actor, two Supporting) have both won three. By the way, I miss the days of always having Jack Nicholson with his black glasses on way up in front of the stage.</p>
<p>11:03 And here&#39;s the category I despise the most: Best Song. Of course, someone gets weepy over &quot;My Heart will go on&quot;.&nbsp;Spacey&nbsp;plays classy - dude, you ain&#39;t Bobby Darin. Randy Newman, aka Oscars&#39; crutch, should be the clear winner. He&#39;s contractually obligated to win.</p>
<p>10:58 The Wolfman&nbsp;wins, but I don&#39;t. That film had so late 80&#39;s F/X effects. Oh, and I just lost Costume Design. Two straight shuns. 8 out of 13. Alice gets two awards = I hurl a bit.</p>
<p>10:55 Oscars fun fact <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%233" target="_blank">#3</a>: The oldest Best Actress winner was Jessica Tandy&nbsp;(age 80) for Driving Miss Daisy in 1989.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:54 Here&#39;s the the Brits: I just heard The Rumble Strips&#39; &quot;Boys &amp; Girls in Love&quot; in a Spanish commercial. Predictably, it was the first few piano keys/acoustic strum at the beginning of the song. Hey, you gotta pay the bills.</p>
<p>10:52 But I did get Inception right for Sound Editing. 8 out of 11. Yet again, they&#39;re praising Nolan; stop feeling bad for him because he wasn&#39;t nominated for Best Director. Oh, and this is the only category where you&#39;ll see Salt and Unstoppable nominated.</p>
<p>10:50 Ahh! I thought &quot;Social Network&quot; would win best Sound Mixing. 7 out of 10. No clear footprint of potential Best Picture win - Inception, King&#39;s Speech, and Social Network are pretty much even.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:45 Reznor wins! 7 out of 9. Indie music websites fire up the motherboards to mention the only news that matters to them.</p>
<p>10:43 Confession time: I wasn&#39;t too impressed with Reznor&#39;s&nbsp;score. Still, it&#39;d be great for him to beat the Zimmer powerhouse. And contrary to the other nominees, the score was actually the most consonant with the incidents presented in the film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:40 Aussies Bale and Kidman - teaming up nationalities is so boring. Who cares about Sound categories? Raise your hands...um, anyone?</p>
<p>10:33 Best Supporting Male: Christian Bale finally wins. Formidable performance, though I would&#39;ve given the edge to Geoffrey Rush. Another ho-hum, let&#39;s name everyone in the production speech. 6 out of 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:30 One hour in, my mom already fell asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:28 Usually, the Foreign Language Film is always an upset. I think &quot;In a Better World&quot; was the safe choice. I bet for the underdog and lost. 5/7</p>
<p>10:25 First Charlie Sheen joke of the night. Ding! Franco wears drag: girls think he looks oh-so-cute any how. Helen Mirren still looks so incredibly hot for her age; why oh why is Russell Brand on stage?!</p>
<p>10:18 By the way, those white outfits Brolin and Bardem are wearing sure look translucent. Literally. King&#39;s Speech wins. 5 out of 6. David Siedler makes first f-you to the speech timer of the night.</p>
<p>10:15 Screenplay time! My favorite awards of the evening. Sorkin wins: great screenplay, even if you can really tell he&#39;s a computer illiterate. 4 out of 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10:12 Wow, this J Lo commercial&nbsp;is downright appalling. No one can actually see this because I&#39;m writing from an Island. Hence, we get the same commercials they transmit in local islands in the Caribbean Sea. Her Spanish is getting worse.</p>
<p>10:08 Pixar wins yet again. I still feel irate because Up beat Fantastic Mr. Fox last year. 3/4 so far.</p>
<p>10:07 I really, really want to see The Illusionist! Anything with the Tati blueprint is gold.</p>
<p>10:05 Mila Kunis. I still remember seeing her in Aerosmith&#39;s video for &quot;Jaded&quot;. And no, I&#39;m not a fan.&nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vil-DtalfIE</p>
<p>10:00 Timberlake is boring the hell out of me. So, here&#39;s tonight&#39;s second fun fact: The last movie in black-and-white to win Best Picture: Schindler&#39;s List. Prior to that: The Apartment in 1960.</p>
<p>9:58 Kirk stalling; that was pretty funny. He must&#39;ve overstayed his welcome, but he&#39;s savoring the moment. Melissa wins: 2/3. Even she got distracted - she was more emotive in the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>9:55 Kirk flirting with Anne Hathaway. Priceless. Even if Melissa will win, I&#39;d&nbsp;give it to Jackie Weaver. Spellbinding performance! Leo automatically wins for most theatrical performance, but nailed the white trash motherly type fairly well. Hailee could be an upset: remember Anna Paquin in the Piano?</p>
<p>9:52 Kirk Douglas...this is&nbsp;Sparta-cus. First bad joke of the night.</p>
<p>9:47 Yay! Got Inception right. Contrary to the Alice and Wonderland winners, who were genuinely nervous, this guy just acknowledged Nolan and left. Boring speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:45 0/1 already. Alice in Wonderland: anybody else thought this film was a snoozefest?&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:42 Tom Hanks, as graceful as ever. I&#39;m digging the Oscar fun facts; dammit, my idea was already planned. Art Direction! If King&#39;s Speech doesn&#39;t win, I&#39;ll be greatly upset.</p>
<p>9:40 Marky Mark! Instantly feeling the vibration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:37 Coolest thing about the opening skit: DeLorean!&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:35 Um, I&#39;m not really digging the SNL routine. Get with the show already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:30 Before the Oscars begin, I have to get my mouse. If I don&#39;t, I&#39;m risking carpet tunnel. Fingers hurt already.</p>
<p>9:23 Oh no. They&#39;re revisiting Benigni&#39;s acceptance win. Any one see Pinocchio? One of the most annoying acceptance wins, but Sally Field&#39;s &quot;You like me, you really like me!&quot; speech tops the cake.</p>
<p>9:20 Ugh. I have to tolerate a boat full of uninspired Spanish commercials. And believe me, the Oscars are chock-full with commercials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:15 Oscars fun fact: The only X rated film to win Best Picture was Midnight Cowboy in 1969.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9:10 Is anyone paying attention to Ben Mankewicz, aka, I was fired from At the Movies. At least he was much better than Ben Lyons: he&#39;s basically a publicity machine and a celebrity hugger.</p>
<p>9:01 An observation: this is going to be one of the most predictable Oscars in quite some time. These are my educated (or not) guesses. Note: I haven&#39;t seen any of the short form categories, so I think it&#39;s irrelevant to try my hand at these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading Actor: Colin Firth &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;<br />Supporting Actor: Christian Bale &ldquo;The Fighter&rdquo;<br />Leading Actress: Natalie Portman &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo;<br />Supporting Actress: Melissa Leo &ldquo;The Fighter&rdquo;<br />Animated Feature: &ldquo;Toy Story 3&rdquo;<br />Art Direction: &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;<br />Cinematography: Inception&rdquo;<br />Costume Design: &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;<br />Directing: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;<br />Documentary Feature: &ldquo;Inside Job&rdquo;<br />Documentary Short: N/A<br />Film Editing: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;<br />Foreign Language Film: &ldquo;Incendies&rdquo;<br />Makeup: &ldquo;Barney&rsquo;s Version&rdquo;<br />Original Score: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;<br />Original Song: &ldquo;We Belong Together&rdquo; from Toy Story 3<br />Animated Short Film : N/A<br />Live action Short Film: N/A<br />Sound Editing: &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;<br />Sound Mixing: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;<br />Visual Effects: &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;<br />Adapted Screenplay: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;<br />Original Screenplay: &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Speech&rdquo;<br />Best Picture: &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;</p>
<p>8:59 Well Mark, I can&#39;t stand Ryan Seacrest. I wisely avoided E! television.</p>
<p>8:54 Hey guys! Juan speaking. I have to say, I barely made it here. Of all days, I took a detour from my usual dull life by going to a freezing river. The highlight: almost falling my ass off due to a slippery rock. But enough about that: welcome to the Oscars. It&#39;s going to be a loooong&nbsp;night, so grab a beer and let&#39;s talk some movies.&nbsp;Oh, and I have to say that Joe is a tough act to follow. He&#39;s actually much more funnier than he gives himself credit for.</p>
