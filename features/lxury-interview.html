  <p>Looking out into the ocean, the hazy, summer sun settles on the horizon. &nbsp;Here, on the beach, Annie Mac stands in her DJ booth addressing the thousands of ravers who are <span word="revelling" data-scaytid="1">revelling</span> in the beats of the well-received headline set, accompanied by a continually changing LED backdrop and jaw-dropping special effects. &nbsp;Such was the extreme transformation of Weston-Super-Mare beach for the UK leg of the Corona <span word="SunSets" data-scaytid="2">SunSets</span> festival that, without knowing otherwise, you could easily have believed that you were in Ibiza. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWOEjRjciY">This unofficial video</a>,&nbsp;posted to YouTube, helps to give some idea of the enormity of the event.</p>
<p>Spread over two stages and the first in a series of worldwide festivals, Corona <span word="SunSets" data-scaytid="6">SunSets</span> UK featured some of the biggest names in the electronic music scene, including Disclosure, MK and Eats Everything. &nbsp;The line-up also included some notable up-and-comers, including Kidnap Kid, <span word="Tieks" data-scaytid="10">Tieks</span> and <span word="Lxury" data-scaytid="7">Lxury</span>.</p>
<p><span word="Lxury&#039;s" data-scaytid="12">Lxury&#39;s</span> music has an experimental quality that brings to mind artists such as Caribou and Four <span word="Tet" data-scaytid="13">Tet</span>, but with a sound more deeply rooted in house music. &nbsp;His first EP, <strong>Playground</strong>, was recently put out on <span word="über-cool" data-scaytid="15">über-cool</span>&nbsp;dance music label Greco-Roman (co-founded by Hot Chip&#39;s Joe Goddard) and, as he explained when he met up with Craig Stevens after his set at Corona <span word="SunSets" data-scaytid="14">SunSets</span>, he&#39;s already looking forward to his next release.</p>
<p><strong>Craig: &nbsp;Are you used to doing sets so early in the day?</strong></p>
<p><span word="Lxury" data-scaytid="17">Lxury</span>: &nbsp;No, not at all. &nbsp;It&#39;s usually really late at night, say <span word="2am" data-scaytid="19">2am</span> to <span word="3am" data-scaytid="20">3am</span> in the morning. &nbsp;And I&#39;ve never played on a beach before. &nbsp;So it was quite an unusual set. &nbsp;But it was cool, it was good.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Are you fully recovered from Glastonbury last weekend?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t say I was recovered, no! &nbsp;More that I&#39;ve accepted that I&#39;m back at home. &nbsp;I wish I was back at Glastonbury. &nbsp;I really like Glastonbury.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;How did your Glastonbury sets go?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Really well. &nbsp;The first set was at BBC Introducing. &nbsp;That felt quite serious. &nbsp;The second set was much more laid back. &nbsp;It was in a bigger tent but it felt more chilled.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Which other artists did you see at Glastonbury?</strong></p>
<p>L &nbsp;Well, I went home on the Saturday but, before I left, I saw Sun Ra <span word="Arkestra" data-scaytid="21">Arkestra</span> and <span word="Haim" data-scaytid="22">Haim</span>. &nbsp;And I only saw <span word="Haim" data-scaytid="23">Haim</span> because I was dragged there by some girl friends.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;What did you spend the rest of your time doing?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Exploring. &nbsp;It&#39;s such a big place. &nbsp;You just wonder around and stumble upon things, which is really good. &nbsp;I had no idea where I was going.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Did you end up seeing anything especially out of the ordinary?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Sun Ra<em> </em>was pretty extraordinary. &nbsp;It was like a gig from outer space. &nbsp;And that&#39;s not me &ldquo;enjoying Glastonbury&rdquo;...it was ethereal; <span word="sci-fi" data-scaytid="26">sci-fi</span> and chilled; exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;You&#39;ve just released your EP <em>Playground</em>. &nbsp;Are you happy with the reception it&#39;s received?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s been interesting, really. &nbsp;The title track, <em>Playground</em>, is different to anything I&#39;ve done before and it&#39;s been interesting to see how it goes down, to see the reaction to it.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Has the reaction been as you had hoped?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Definitely. &nbsp;When I was making it, I knew it was different to anything I&#39;ve done before. &nbsp;It&#39;s faster and upbeat, and mixes things up a bit. &nbsp;And it&#39;s gone down really well.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;How do you go about making your tracks? &nbsp;Do you stick to one piece of software? &nbsp;Do you always start with a sample?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;It varies. &nbsp;There has to be an influence behind it. &nbsp;A lot of people will start with a kick and build a track from there, but that&#39;s too methodical for me. &nbsp;I like to go out with a <span word="dictaphone" data-scaytid="27">dictaphone</span> and record some things. &nbsp;Or see some things and get my mind churning. &nbsp;And then I&#39;ll go back and make a song on a computer. &nbsp;I know it&#39;s not completely natural in that I rely on music software to build the track but it has to develop from somewhere. &nbsp;Take us, sitting here, for example. &nbsp;It&#39;s quite a strange environment; a green floor, a wooden table, carrots and tomatoes. &nbsp;Even this is getting my brain going.</p>
<p>The whole <strong>Playground</strong> EP is quite strange. &nbsp;It ended up being an upbeat, very danceable, happy EP, but I made it whilst living in a tiny room under the <span word="M4" data-scaytid="28">M4</span>, the size of a Renault Scenic with no daylight. &nbsp; It was quite a contrast to how I was feeling at the time.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Do you think this more upbeat sound is indicative of the way your sound is developing? &nbsp;Can we expect more of that sort of music going forward?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;I moved into a new house with a new studio about two weeks ago, and I&#39;m just settling in. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what vibe to expect. &nbsp;My next EP might well end up being more dark and down-tempo.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;By the sounds of it, you&#39;re anticipating another EP for your next release, rather than an album?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m definitely in EP mode. &nbsp;I&#39;m not getting into an album until that needs to happen. &nbsp;And when that does, I&#39;ll probably fuck off to the Highlands of Scotland and properly get into it.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;I saw you talking to the Disclosure boys just a few minutes ago. &nbsp;And you co-produced the track <em>J.A.W.S.</em> with them a while back. &nbsp;How was it collaborating on a track?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;It was really easy to do. &nbsp;I&#39;ve known Guy [<em>Lawrence</em>] for many years, since college. &nbsp;I had a tune and he said that we should release it on Method, which is his manager&#39;s label. &nbsp;We agreed that he would co-produce it. &nbsp;I was living in this tiny room, so we went to his studio to finish it off.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Do you enjoy the collaborative process?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Yeah, I really enjoy working with different artists. &nbsp;I like it when there&#39;s juxtaposition; when there are artists that you wouldn&#39;t ordinarily expect to fit together.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;So, if you had to pick someone to be the juxtaposition to your style of music, who would you say that was?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Kate Bush, maybe? &nbsp;I really like Kate Bush. &nbsp;And to work with her would be really interesting. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t want to be disappointed though, she&#39;s one of my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="29">favourite</span> artists and they always say you should never meet your heroes.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;In terms of what you&#39;ve got planned for the rest of the summer, you were talking about another EP so presumably, you&#39;re still writing at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>L: &nbsp;Yeah, completely. &nbsp;I write all the time; it&#39;s not as though I switch in and out of writing mode. &nbsp;But now, I know what I&#39;m writing is for my next EP. &nbsp;And although there&#39;s no pressure, I&#39;m conscious that a second EP says a lot about you as an artist. &nbsp;When you put out your first EP, it&#39;s almost as though you&#39;re finding your feet. &nbsp;But with the second EP, it feels a lot more serious. &nbsp;A lot more people are watching where you&#39;re going.</p>
<p><strong>C: &nbsp;And in terms of live dates over the summer, where can people catch you?</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m playing various dates in Europe but in the UK, I&#39;ll be at Secret Garden Party, Reading and Leeds, and <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="30">Bestival</span>.</p>
<p><em>The Corona <span word="SunSets" data-scaytid="31">SunSets</span> series of festivals continues in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico on July 26, with dates in Acapulco, Toronto and Ibiza in the weeks that follow. &nbsp;For more information and ticket details, check out the Corona <span word="SunSets" data-scaytid="32">SunSets</span> festival website <a href="http://corona.beatport.com/">here</a>.</em></p>
