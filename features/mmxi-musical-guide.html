  <p><em>To look forward we must first look back&hellip;</em></p>
<div>&hellip;Back to 2010. Based on the success and failures, the hype and thus inevitable&nbsp;underwhelm, Pitchfork 10.0s and Internet buzz, we can better understand and&nbsp;predict the months ahead. The trends and patterns that dominated 2010 will&nbsp;surely continue into 2011, and will shape the year to come for better or for worse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Rewind</strong>: With all things considered, 2010 was not a standout year for music. It&nbsp;was a year that saw two extremely anticipated sophomore releases (Vampire Weekend&#39;s <strong>Contra </strong>and MGMT&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Congratulations</strong>) crumble in the face of the gargantuan critic that is the blogosphere,&nbsp;and a year that saw the iconic and unprecedented <em>We Are The World</em> remade into&nbsp;a bland, characterless and auto-tuned pastiche. It was one of the worst years for album sales in recent history, and the first time ever that overall music sales (digital&nbsp;tracks, CD, LP and cassette) declined.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No, 2010 was not a stellar year for music by anybody&rsquo;s account, and the&nbsp;omnipresence of blogs has led to a more cynical and bitter population that revels in&nbsp;trivializing any artistic expression using half-understood pop psychology as a tool.&nbsp;But only a contemptuous misanthropist could go through a full twelve months without&nbsp;finding anything of aural merit. And 2010 had some very redeeming qualities.&nbsp;It was a year that solidified Arcade Fire&rsquo;s position in the history of music, and a year&nbsp;that saw the Fab Four&rsquo;s entire discography released digitally for the first time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2010 was also a year that saw Michael Jackson&rsquo;s title as the &ldquo;King of Pop&rdquo;&nbsp;challenged, and the first time in eight years that Pitchfork gave out a 10.0 to a new&nbsp;release &ndash; it so happens that both of these achievements can be claimed by an&nbsp;individual who does not need an ego boost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Fast Forward:</strong> 2011 is going to be a huge year in music. Huge. With the much&nbsp;anticipated debut from London wunderkind, James Blake; a collaboration between&nbsp;the kings of hip hop, Kanye West and Jay-Z; expected releases from Coldplay, Dr.&nbsp;Dre, R.E.M. and the Foo Fighters; firm rumors from U2, The Beastie Boys and The&nbsp;Cars (what decade is this again?), there truly will be something for audiophiles of every taste. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the fact that both The Strokes and Radiohead&nbsp;are presumably putting out their 4th and 8th albums (respectively). Yes, it&rsquo;s going to be&nbsp;a huge year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Can Kanye Do It Again?</u></div>
<div>Thank God for Kanye West. Sure, he is rude and arrogant, but imagine how dull&nbsp;the music scene would be without him. We need over-the-top and exaggerated&nbsp;caricatures to give us an escape from the dull ennui of pre-packaged, consumerist&nbsp;middle-class life. His gestures are so destructive, romantic and grand (like jumping&nbsp;into a swimming pool wearing a tuxedo) that you can&rsquo;t help but think that self-</div>
<div>sabotage is his ultimate pursuit. Regardless of that, Kanye owned 2010 &ndash; there&#39;s no denying it. The Herculean juggernaut that is <strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong>&nbsp;not only garnered West the utmost respect from critics who had previously written&nbsp;him off as a colorful cliché, but it overshadowed his previous sins (sorry Taylor).&nbsp;And Kanye&rsquo;s reign is far from over. His upcoming collaboration with Jay-Z, <strong>Watch&nbsp;The Throne</strong>, is one of the most anticipated releases of the year, and it will surely aid&nbsp;Kanye on his quest of being &ldquo;the greatest artist of all time&rdquo;.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Indie Heavyweights Will Dominate</u></div>
<div>Indie is dead. Finished. Now that major record labels (iTunes included) are&nbsp;marketing artists as &ldquo;indie&rdquo; in an attempt to latch on to the burgeoning movement,&nbsp;the term has become meaningless. With that said, many so-called indie veterans&nbsp;are releasing albums in 2011, and are eager to lose the now-unfortunately-corporate&nbsp;moniker. With a stronger focus on vocals and lyricism, Death Cab For Cutie&rsquo;s</div>
<div>seventh studio album, <strong>Codes And Keys</strong>, will be a more mature and vulnerable&nbsp;release. Ben Gibbard has called the record &ldquo;achingly gorgeous&rdquo; and as long as it&nbsp;veers away from the dark self-loathing of 2008&rsquo;s <strong>Narrow Stairs</strong>, it will be one of the year&rsquo;s more important releases. The Decemberists&rsquo; last record was a clumsy, long&nbsp;and overly ambitious concept album that failed to find a demographic. Learning</div>
<div>from their mistakes, the Portland five-piece promises a hook-heavy, Smiths and&nbsp;R.E.M.-inspired 6th album. <a href="../reviews/music/decemberists/king-dead.html"><strong>The King Is Dead</strong></a> was recorded entirely in a converted&nbsp;farmhouse, which explains the album&rsquo;s apparent &ldquo;rustic&rdquo; sound. After releasing one of the best albums of 2008, Fleet Foxes essentially dropped off of the musical radar.&nbsp;But expect their return in 2011, where their &ldquo;less poppy&rdquo; yet still much-hyped 2nd album will either fall victim to the &lsquo;sophomore slump&rsquo; or overcome, and be among the&nbsp;best of the year.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>The Holy Trinity of Fem-Pop</u></div>
<div>Love to hate them, hate to love them, pretend to hate them but actually have a&nbsp;secret drawer dedicated to their memorabilia&hellip; No matter what your stance on&nbsp;female pop these days, nobody can deny the musical and social pertinence all three&nbsp;of the following women have on contemporary society. Britney Spears, Beyoncé and&nbsp;Lady Gaga all have 2011 release dates, which means fierce competition between</div>
<div>these pop divas. Lady Gaga has a slight advantage, with <strong>The Fame Monster</strong> being&nbsp;the best selling record of 2010 (even though it was actually an EP). And the world will surely go gaga again for 2011&rsquo;s<strong> Born This Way</strong>. Gaga is calling her sophomore&nbsp;release &quot;a marriage of electronic music with major, epic, dare I even say, metal&nbsp;or rock &#39;n&#39; roll, pop, anthemic style melodies with really sledge-hammering dance&nbsp;beats.&quot; Wow. Will Gaga rule the pop charts of 2011? Probably. Will the album be&nbsp;of any substance? Probably not. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped the superstar from calling&nbsp;<strong>Born This Way</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;the greatest album of this decade&rdquo;. Despite a breakdown of Biblical&nbsp;proportions, Britney Spears is back in the studio and working on her seventh album.&nbsp;Having already released the first single to the upcoming record, Spears seems back&nbsp;on form; that&rsquo;s assuming she can make it through the year without shaving her head.&nbsp;We have been given very few details regarding the release of Beyoncé&rsquo;s fourth&nbsp;album. All we know is that producer Sean Garrett has called it her &ldquo;biggest album&nbsp;ever.&rdquo; Expect great things.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Fat Possums Have Never Looked Better</u></div>
<div>Oh, the struggles of being an independent record label in this day and age. With the&nbsp;power and omnipresence of iTunes monopolizing the record industry, it&rsquo;s damn hard&nbsp;for the little guy to keep up. The Mississippi-based Fat Possum Records are among&nbsp;many independent labels helping to localize and personalize the contemporary&nbsp;music scene. All the more power to them. 2010 was a big year for Fat Possum, with&nbsp;excellent releases from The Walkmen, Wavves and The Black Keys. But they also&nbsp;suffered the death of garage rock icon Jay Reatard, and were victim to the aforesaid&nbsp;slump in album sales. But things are looking up. 2011 will see this large rodent&nbsp;revel in success &ndash; both critical and commercial. Two January releases will help&nbsp;Fat Possum start the year in top shape. Tennis, following in the tradition of Mates&nbsp;of State and Arcade Fire, is composed of newly-weds who&rsquo;s eight month nautical&nbsp;sojourn has resulted in an album of charming, tropic and effervescent beach-pop. Evoking the warped nostalgia of long summer days, <a href="../reviews/music/tennis/cape-dory.html"><strong>Cape Dory</strong></a> is the year&rsquo;s most&nbsp;anticipated debut. Smith Westerns burst onto the music scene with the subtlety of&nbsp;a foghorn, and their 2009 eponymous debut displayed lo-fi rock at its finest. For&nbsp;their sophomore release, <a href="../reviews/music/smith-westerns/dye-it-blonde.html"><strong>Dye It Blonde</strong></a>, the Chicago quartet are stepping out of the&nbsp;garage and into the studio. With a self-described &ldquo;poppy and catchy&rdquo; sound, the&nbsp;album could expand the band&rsquo;s listenership and solidify their position as first-rate&nbsp;purveyors of noise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>The Rise of the Machines</u></div>
<div>As technology advances, so do the possibilities of musical opportunism. Success is&nbsp;no longer dependent on your guitar or vocal ability. Now, all you need is a laptop&nbsp;and a reclusive lifestyle. By relying so heavily on machines to produce artistic&nbsp;expression, we are inadvertently accelerating the rate of obsolescence. Human&nbsp;obsolescence. James Blake, a London-based producer, perfectly captures the</div>
<div>digitalized zeitgeist. Last year, he released three EPs, each of which mutates and&nbsp;transforms conventional electronic music in a different way. Originally a dubstep producer, Blake incorporates aspects of dub into his music in an unprecedented manner. The mystique surrounding this young prodigy almost surpasses the hype&nbsp;for his debut LP. An early album of the year contender? Why not? Anthony Gonzalez,&nbsp;the French mastermind behind the shoegaze outfit M83, announced that his 6th&nbsp;album is going to be &ldquo;very, very, very epic.&rdquo; He had me at the second &lsquo;very&rsquo;. Gonzalez creates electronic and ambient sounds that inhabit a strange cosmic&nbsp;sector of the musical stratosphere, and this &ldquo;darker&rdquo; release will see him explore&nbsp;new ground. Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never)&nbsp;and Joel Ford (Tigercity), employs antiquated production techniques to create a&nbsp;surprisingly relevant albeit nostalgic sound. Their foray into the electronica world of pinball machines, TV soundtracks, Atari and disco is authentic to say the least.&nbsp;Using an extensive arsenal of analog synthesizers, Games are committed to&nbsp;recreating the gaudy yet evocative sounds of the &lsquo;80s. And their yet-to-be-titled</div>
<div>debut could be one of the year&rsquo;s biggest surprises.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>And Chillwave Hasn&rsquo;t Gloriously Imploded Yet</u></div>
<div>Remember chillwave? Probably not. The warped and nostalgic bedroom movement&nbsp;that started as a taxonomist&rsquo;s tool to describe cassette-recorded sounds of the past quickly established itself as a legitimate genre (you can find chillwave on iTunes),&nbsp;and then disappeared as quietly as it came. The buzz surrounding chillwave has&nbsp;died down significantly, but its remnants&nbsp;will surely influence multi-instrumentalists for years to come. If there&rsquo;s one artist that&rsquo;s likely to withstand the&nbsp;fallout and backlash of the misguided chillwave movement, it&rsquo;s Toro Y Moi &ndash; the&nbsp;stage name of Chazwick Bundick. Chaz helped found the genre with his arrestingly&nbsp;evocative debut, <strong>Causers of This</strong>. Opting for a studio setting instead of a laptop,&nbsp;Bundick&rsquo;s sophomore record, <strong>Underneath the Pine</strong>, is reportedly &ldquo;less chill and more&nbsp;funk&rdquo;, and will determine whether Toro Y Moi can transcend its chillwave roots. 2010&nbsp;was also known as the post-<strong>Merriweather</strong><strong> Post Pavilion</strong> year. Animal Collective, who&nbsp;completely dominated 2009, has kept out of the limelight since then. One-third of&nbsp;the group, Noah Lennox (better known by his stage name, Panda Bear), has helped&nbsp;ease our AnCo withdrawals, with reports of a follow-up to the phenomenal <strong>Person&nbsp;Pitch</strong>. Panda Bear&rsquo;s fourth album now has a release date and a name: <strong>Tomboy</strong>. With&nbsp;a heavier focus on instrumentation rather than loops, and influence from Nirvana,&nbsp;the record could easily end up being Lennox&rsquo;s <strong>Nevermind.</strong>&nbsp;In other words, career-defining.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>The Year of&nbsp;The Strokes</u></div>
<div>What can I say about The Strokes that hasn&rsquo;t already been said before? I could&nbsp;call them &quot;the forefathers of a bold new era in rock&quot;, or &quot;the second coming of The&nbsp;Velvet Underground&quot;, or even pull out superlatives and go as far as &quot;the greatest&nbsp;rock band since the Rolling Stones&quot; - but all that has already been said. The New&nbsp;Yorkers&rsquo; debut was awarded the &ldquo;album of the decade&rdquo; title by NME, and they</div>
<div>have been called the &ldquo;most important act of our generation&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s funny to think it&#39;s been ten years since <strong>Is This It</strong>, and five years since the band&rsquo;s last release; yet&nbsp;The Strokes seem as relevant as ever. Hype really does lend itself to longevity. For&nbsp;the last few years, rumors of The Strokes&#39; fourth album have floated around in the&nbsp;backwaters of the Internet, but now Julian Casablancas confirmed (via Twitter) that&nbsp;the album is finished and will be released this year. The fact is, The Strokes were the&nbsp;most important artist of the past decade. They didn&rsquo;t just capture a zeitgeist; they defined a generation. But the question remains: is there any room for&nbsp;unabashed rock in the music landscape of today? We now have machines instead&nbsp;of instruments, producers in lieu of performers, and the blogosphere taking the place&nbsp;of old-fashioned print magazines. So do we have room for The Strokes? I certainly&nbsp;hope so. Long live the kings of modern rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. Long live The Strokes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So there it is, 2011. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s a good one, because if the Mayans were right, it&nbsp;could be the last year of music, let alone the human race.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: I do not take any responsibility for the quality of any of these upcoming&nbsp;releases. These albums are anticipated, not recommended, and if they fail to live up&nbsp;to expectations, please don&rsquo;t blame me.</em></div>
