  <p>Back in February,&nbsp;<span word="Krist" data-scaytid="3">Krist</span> <span word="Novoselic" data-scaytid="4">Novoselic</span>&nbsp;tweeted to <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23happybirthdaykurtcobain">#<span word="happybirthdaykurtcobain" data-scaytid="5">happybirthdaykurtcobain</span></a>.&nbsp; It would&#39;ve been&nbsp;Kurt <span word="Cobain&#039;s" data-scaytid="6">Cobain&#39;s</span> 44th birthday; long after teenage angst paid off well, long after he was bored and old.&nbsp; His death seemed an easy write-off for a generation based in cynicism, (that&#39;s how I remember it, anyway, aside from a candlelight vigil, a couple subsequent suicides and a huge retrospective in Rolling Stone magazine), and for the generation&#39;s parents whose arrogance remained self-righteous, unjustifiable and typically out of touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peace and Love sold its soul for Expensive Drugs and Wall Street, naturally its progeny approached its own formative development with a keen sense of what it&#39;s like to be proud of obedience or proud of fraudulence.&nbsp; If there&#39;s a legend to <span word="Cobain" data-scaytid="8">Cobain</span>, it&#39;s now being upheld by digitized youth enamored with the romantic idea conjured by the notion of Teen Spirit, whatever that was, (deodorant, essentially).&nbsp; The same could&#39;ve been said about many 90s youth regarding Lizard Kings, (thank you,&nbsp;Oliver Stone), but&nbsp;Jim Morrison&nbsp;at least had the good sense to off himself after his relevance had expired.&nbsp; For those of us whose minds were irrevocably altered by&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="2">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;twenty years ago, <span word="Cobain&#039;s" data-scaytid="7">Cobain&#39;s</span> suicide felt like betrayal, and whatever fire he&#39;d ignited in all of us he&#39;d selfishly cut the wick and left the light burning long enough to leave ash, and pain, in its wake.&nbsp; Whatever satisfaction was gained from Alternative music&#39;s intrusion into the mainstream&#39;s contentment to suck, all of it had become as pointless and meaningless as Woodstock (especially once that milestone found sponsorship through Pepsi).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a spearhead like <span word="Cobain" data-scaytid="9">Cobain</span> leading the charge for many fucked and disenfranchised youth, though, you almost can&#39;t blame the old heads for gloating.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the Baby Boomers folded in the face of capitalism, no one sells out like a junkie.&nbsp; Besides, Nirvana&#39;s contribution to popular music was met with the same &quot;smelling shit&quot; grimace&nbsp;The Beatles&nbsp;had left on their parents&#39; faces almost thirty years prior.&nbsp; Nirvana&#39;s first appearance on Saturday Night Live was something I recall anticipating for the length of an entire Saturday up until 11:30 PM.&nbsp; My Father&#39;s attitude toward what he&#39;d witnessed, especially when I&#39;d made the Ed Sullivan comparison, bore a level of misunderstanding and superiority I hoped I&#39;d never hold over my own children.</p>
<p>Understanding, though, now as a 34 year-old parent, remaining in touch and respectful isn&#39;t the easiest thing to achieve, especially when the generations&#39; popular music continues to devolve.&nbsp; As the years tick by and hard work and creativity continue to take a backseat to shortcuts and complacency, albums matter less and less on a grand scale, and I feel fortunate to have experienced an album so potent.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if any album has had the impact of&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="10">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;since its release.&nbsp; Well, maybe&nbsp;Eminem&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Marshall <span word="Mathers" data-scaytid="11">Mathers</span> LP</strong>, but tipping the scales on hate speech and first amendment debates isn&#39;t something one would consider inspirational.&nbsp; Controversial?&nbsp; Sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m listening to the album now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A couple days after I&#39;d turned 15, my Christmas gift from at least three people was&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="12">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;on cassette.&nbsp; I remember giving one to my brother, not sure where the other wound up.&nbsp; I was very eager to give it a listen so, as not to offend the adults around me, I found a Walkman and pretty much kept myself plugged into it for the length of the day.&nbsp; As far as the visceral experiences one has as a teenager, I felt like I was being introduced to something important and exciting.&nbsp; What I didn&#39;t know at the time was that Nirvana&#39;s output was an appropriation of&nbsp;Pixies&#39; constructs and Beatles&#39; melodies.&nbsp; What I also didn&#39;t understand was that there were a lot of bands, from Seattle and other parts of the <span word="U.S" data-scaytid="14">U.S</span>., that were working toward exposing the independent underground.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="13">Nevermind</span></strong> just happened to be the first.</p>
<p>Stock may have diminished to some extent on this album.&nbsp; The unfortunate aspect of being essential is that rock radio does all it can to wring singles out like wet towels and sort of leave them worn and wrinkled; used.&nbsp; Sooner or later, you can&#39;t stand them anymore.&nbsp; <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> has definitely found itself alongside <em>Stairway To Heaven</em> or <em>You Shook Me All Night Long</em>, veritable rock monuments drained of any and all purpose or meaning thanks to continual, pointless airplay.&nbsp; Because of this, what you find listening to&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="15">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;twenty years later is that it&#39;s not a good album because of <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> or <em>In Bloom</em>.&nbsp; Sure the A-Side still contains some great tracks that haven&#39;t yet lost their appeal, songs like <em>Come As You Are</em> and <em>Lithium</em> remain some of the album&#39;s best moments.&nbsp; <em>Breed</em>?&nbsp; Infectious.&nbsp; (I remember thinking there was some real poetic genius behind the &quot;We can plant a house/We can build a tree&quot; lyric.&nbsp; Now I hear the line and think, &quot;Oh.&nbsp; Heroin.&quot;)&nbsp; Granted,&nbsp;<span word="Nevermind&#039;s" data-scaytid="16"><strong>Nevermind</strong>&#39;s</span> entire first side bred an entire youth culture and hijacked about ten dollars from every wallet, but the B-Side...</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="17">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;can still be called one of the greatest rock albums of all time, it&#39;s because of the B-Side.&nbsp; Aside from <em>Territorial <span word="Pissings" data-scaytid="21">Pissings</span></em>&#39; mock n&#39; roll appropriation of The <span word="Youngbloods" data-scaytid="22">Youngbloods</span>, <em>Drain You</em> is probably one of the best songs <span word="Cobain" data-scaytid="18">Cobain</span> ever wrote, a minimally accessible, though hook savvy, pop abstraction.&nbsp; <em>Lounge Act</em> resonated more with me than any other song on the album, enamored with <span word="Cobain&#039;s" data-scaytid="19">Cobain&#39;s</span> guitar phrasing and <span word="Novoselic&#039;s" data-scaytid="23">Novoselic&#39;s</span> low end.&nbsp; And, I really dug the chorus.&nbsp; (Dork moment:&nbsp; I used to take pencil sticks, play this song, and pretend I was drumming along.)&nbsp; Honestly, what made Nirvana the ultimate anti-Pop group, were their B-sides and rarities.&nbsp; They knew how to dress up a song for mass consumption, but also how to properly convey where they were from musically.&nbsp; Whatever luster&#39;s faded from the &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; that brought Nirvana their success,&nbsp;<span word="Nevermind&#039;s" data-scaytid="20"><strong>Nevermind</strong>&#39;s</span> still credible.&nbsp; It&#39;s good when you realize at least SOME of your teenage epiphanies continue to hold true.</p>
<p>Twenty years.</p>
<p><span word="Clichés" data-scaytid="25">Clichés</span> being <span word="clichés" data-scaytid="26">clichés</span>, there were doors opened for me that I&#39;ve been navigating ever since my three copies of&nbsp;<strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="24">Nevermind</span></strong>&nbsp;found permanence in my life, a relic of the utmost value in terms of what it&#39;s offered me.&nbsp; I can say with all certainty that this band and this album changed my perspective and exposed me to albums, songs and bands that I may have never discovered otherwise.&nbsp; I&#39;m grateful, but I&#39;m also pissed off that I&#39;m emotionally caught up in a nostalgic &quot;remember when.&quot;</p>
