  <p>The only performer to win the coveted Mercury Music Prize on more than one occasion, <span word="PJ" data-scaytid="2">PJ</span> Harvey pulls off that rarest of tricks by managing to combine challenging and inventive art with mainstream success. Her most recent album, <strong>Let England Shake</strong>, was near-universally adored and made her more talked about than arguably she&#39;s ever been before, but what of her other albums? The West Country girl has been putting out material for two decades now and between us here at No Ripcord, we&#39;ve compiled the definitive guide to help you dig deeper into a back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="3">catalogue</span> that&#39;s bursting at the seams with riches.</p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Dry" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveydry.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />Dry - 1992</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1992, major record labels subscribed to the image of grunge as a sign of defiance and individuality. So while they invested in plenty of guitar-strumming chicks acting tough, little did UK label Island Records knew that the 22 year old art student they had just acquired was actually the real deal. It&rsquo;s been a remarkable run for Harvey, who&rsquo;s flawlessly morphed into different guises with a full tank of confidence. All of which makes it all the more pleasurable to revisit <strong>Dry </strong>two decades after its release, and it still holds up as a brash, defiant slice of feminist empowerment that portrays Harvey at her most unrefined. Having been inculcated to blues at a very early age, she took that influence and twisted it into a <span word="juddering" data-scaytid="5">juddering</span>, roaring monster of a record married with thick chords and <span word="woolly" data-scaytid="6">woolly</span> distortion. Debut records seldom arrive with this much poise. <em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="7">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Rid Of Me" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveyridofme.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />Rid Of Me - 1993</strong></p>
<p>I doubt many people have seen the cover to <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> and not been stricken with awe at what the record might sound like. This is Harvey at her most unhinged and raw, right from the unforgettable climax of the opening title track &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Lick my legs / I&rsquo;m on fire / Lick my legs / Of desire&rdquo;</em>. This &lsquo;Lady <span word="Lazarus’-esque" data-scaytid="8">Lazarus&rsquo;-esque</span> feminist empowerment is excessive yet convincing on lead single, <em><span word="50ft" data-scaytid="9">50ft</span> <span word="Queenie" data-scaytid="10">Queenie</span></em>. &nbsp;It contains her first really <span word="avant-garde" data-scaytid="11">avant-garde</span> moment in the 11/4 panicking strings of <em>Man Size Sextet</em>&nbsp;and, as if to yank a songwriting baton from the hands of Bob Dylan, she covers <em>Highway &#39;61 Revisited</em> with an urgency and tension that totally makes it her own. It was with <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> that Harvey truly proved her genius, even when creating something uncontrollable and frenzied with aggression. <em>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="12">Wragg</span></em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="4 Track Demos" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharvey4trackdemos.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />4-Track Demos - 1993</strong></p>
<p><strong>4-Track Demos</strong> appeared between the release of <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> and work starting on <strong>To Bring You My Love</strong>. It contained eight tracks that had appeared on <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> plus six more previously unreleased. The idea was apparently that of Steve <span word="Albini" data-scaytid="13">Albini</span>, who loved the demos so much he convinced Harvey that they deserved a release of their own. Many commentators preferred the demo versions, claiming that <span word="Albini’s" data-scaytid="14">Albini&rsquo;s</span> trademark production swamped Harvey&rsquo;s vocal range and guitar work in volume and excessive dynamics. What <strong>4-Track Demos</strong> highlights is that <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> is too long by two or three songs. The Demos versions are, as you would expect, a raw and challenging listen; and the unreleased tracks are easily the equal to those on <strong>Rid Of Me</strong>. <strong>4-Track Demos</strong> is not her greatest or definitive album, but it remains the most direct expression of Harvey&rsquo;s art. <em>David Wood</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="To Bring You My Love" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveytobringyoumylove.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />To Bring You My Love - 1995</strong></p>
<p><span word="PJ" data-scaytid="15">PJ</span> Harvey&rsquo;s <strong>To Bring You My Love</strong> <span word="signalled" data-scaytid="17">signalled</span> a transition in her artistic development, namely the break-up of her trio and the beginning of a fruitful creative relationship with producer Flood and musician John Parish. The album itself is forged out of blues lust and longing, its title track a repetitious <span word="kerrang" data-scaytid="18">kerrang</span> of guitar riff, Harvey exuding a powerful mix of frustrated desperation. Perhaps unintentionally built out of the historical significance of American blues and its reinvention via the hands of British rock musicians, <strong>To Bring You My Love</strong> was enlivened by Harvey&rsquo;s moves toward vulnerability (<em>C&rsquo;mon Billy</em>, <em><span word="Teclo" data-scaytid="19">Teclo</span></em>, <em>Down By The Water</em>), but not at the expense of the energy that brought her notoriety in the first place with <strong>Dry </strong>and <strong>Rid Of Me</strong> (<em>Meet <span word="Ze" data-scaytid="20">Ze</span> <span word="Monsta" data-scaytid="21">Monsta</span></em>, <em>Long Snake Moan</em>). At a time when &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; was growing <span word="passé" data-scaytid="22">passé</span>, Harvey&rsquo;s <strong>To Bring You My Love</strong> was smartly reliant on more than squealing guitars and sexualized venom. <em>Sean Caldwell</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Dance Hall at Louse Point" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveydancehall.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />Dance Hall At Louse Point (with John Parish) - 1996</strong></p>
<p>In many ways, this was <span word="PJ" data-scaytid="23">PJ</span> Harvey&rsquo;s invisible album. In the UK, only one radio presenter would regularly play songs from this record, and that was her stalwart friend and supporter, John Peel. Even then, despite his indefatigable support, <strong>Dance Hall At Louse Point</strong> divided Harvey&rsquo;s fan base &ndash; this was after all, strictly speaking, no <span word="PJ" data-scaytid="25">PJ</span> Harvey album in the traditional sense. Harvey herself would later cite the album as an &ldquo;enormous turning point&rdquo; and one she regarded it as a &ldquo;test&rdquo; to her lyric writing. <em>&ldquo;Take me one more time,&rdquo;</em> pleads Harvey, repeatedly, in the final moments of the album, something her fan base did with further offerings. Interestingly, if this album&rsquo;s louder aspects got something out of her system, the result was to steer her next long player, <strong>Is This Desire?</strong>, an all-together more subdued affair, to critical success. <em>Gavin <span word="Fearnley" data-scaytid="27">Fearnley</span></em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Is This Desire?" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveyisthisdesire.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />Is This Desire? - 1998</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is This Desire?</strong> is the forgotten child of Harvey&rsquo;s body of work, often overshadowed by showier or more immediate, award-winning albums. This is unfair, as it&rsquo;s a quieter, more subtle affair, containing a number of songs that rank among her best, as well as a more expansive musical palette taking on more keyboard and electronic sounds. After the psycho-sexual blues of <strong>To Bring You My Love</strong>, Harvey retreated to a less personal storytelling style, often writing in the third person. The result was an atmospheric set of songs with particular highlights being opener <em><span word="Angelene" data-scaytid="28">Angelene</span></em>, the spooky whispering of <em>The Wind</em>, single <em>A Perfect Day Elise</em>, <em>The River</em> (inspired by a Flannery O&rsquo;Connor short story) and the fragile, haunting title track. <em>David Wood</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveystories.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea - 2000</strong></p>
<p>An album about lost love, lust and cities. The album is as influenced by New York as it is by Patti Smith&rsquo;s best moments (why else are horses mentioned throughout?) with <em>Good Fortune</em>, <em>This Mess We&rsquo;re In</em> and <em>You Said Something</em> all centering painful stories around the Big Apple. And while the songs are of a solidly melancholic subject, there&rsquo;s no hint of self-pity; it&rsquo;s the opposite. Miss Polly Jean romps through the album; <em>Kamikaze </em>is the sexiest break up song going and <em>This Is Love</em> is the female <em>Whole Lotta Love</em>. With its riffs and lust, what&rsquo;s not to love? Obviously an album with diverse musicianship (<em>We Float</em> sounds like a lost child of the Bristol sound, <em>Beautiful Feeling</em> is <em>White Chalk</em> with guitars) and blatant appeal failed in the charts despite its rightful Mercury award. I never understood why it never went ballistic. <em>James McKenna</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Uh Huh Her" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveyuhhuhher.jpg" vspace="5" width="150" />Uh Huh Her - 2004</strong></p>
<p>Harvey works best on the margins and, perhaps recognising this herself, made <strong>Uh Huh Her</strong> a much more primal and scratchy album than its award-winning predecessor. Whereas <strong>Stories From The City&hellip;</strong> had hooks and melodies, <strong>Uh Huh Her</strong>, from its unfussy cover photo downwards, had jagged edges and listener-wrongfooting turns of pace. This doesn&rsquo;t mean any less attention has been paid to the lyrics though, with the extraordinarily detailed and impassioned <em>The Letter</em> a particular highlight. Harvey also shows her vulnerable side too, with <em>The Pocket Knife</em> featuring a pleading, fragile vocal over barely there instrumentation. <strong>Uh Huh Her</strong> is unlikely to be anyone&rsquo;s favourite album in the PJ Harvey canon, yet it remains, as always, a fascinating snapshot of one of the generation&rsquo;s most enduring and interesting artists. <em>Joe Rivers</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="White Chalk" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveywhitechalk.jpeg" vspace="5" width="150" />White Chalk - 2007</strong></p>
<p>Following the relatively muted response that met <strong>Uh Huh Her</strong>, it was necessary for Harvey to shake things up. What&#39;s surprising though is how she drastically she went about it - not just opting to tone the rock-stylings down, but ditching the guitars completely, learning the piano from scratch and working outside her normal vocal range in search of new inspiration. What really sets it apart in her discography though is its sense of vulnerability; before she was often confrontational, here she laid herself, and her sense of womanhood, almost completely, devastatingly bare, as in the spectacularly creepy lead single <em>When Under Ether</em>, and even the virginal/bridal look she adopted for the album&#39;s cover and promotion. It&#39;s not perfect; the appropriately titled <em>Broken Harp</em> strays a little too far into discomfort and there&#39;s a slight sense of anti-climax; and perhaps in an album so short any minor flaws are less forgivable; but it still might be one of her most unique and startling works. <em>Mark Davison</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="A Woman Walked By" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveyawomanwalkedby.jpg" vspace="5" width="150" />A Woman A Man Walked By (with John Parish) - 2009</strong></p>
<p>In retrospect one can consider this album as being the centrepiece in a loose trilogy between <strong>White Chalk</strong> and <strong>Let England Shake</strong>. All three albums are marked by arrangements and instrumentation heavily influenced by folk-rock, especially the English variant. For this album Parish wrote all the music, Harvey all the lyrics. Freed from the confines of her own compositions Harvey seems to revel in exploring a range of characters and voices. This multiplicity gives the album a slightly disjointed feel, lacking the intense focus of her solo-billed efforts. It has its moments though: <em>Sixteen, Fifteen, Fourteen</em> sounds like a distant cousin to Zeppelin&rsquo;s <em>Four Sticks</em>, while on the title track Harvey hasn&rsquo;t sounded as crazy since <em>Who the Fuck?</em> <em>David Wood</em></p>
<p><strong><img align="left" alt="Let England Shake" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/pjharveyletenglandshake.jpg" vspace="5" width="150" />Let England Shake - 2011</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let England Shake</strong> was a drastic turn of the pen for PJ Harvey. Always capable of powerful lyrics, it was on this album that she relentlessly confronted major issues, writing lyrics before music and becoming unapologetically political. Harvey&rsquo;s effortlessly gut-wrenching imagery, such as the deadpan, <em>&ldquo;Soldiers fell like lumps of meat&rdquo;</em>, were foregrounded by her new, narrator-like vocal style, and by her beautiful expansion on <strong>White Chalk</strong>&rsquo;s sparse piano arrangements. No longer striving to make our blood curdle like she did for so many years, Harvey is confident and controlled; and her reassurance and clear, coherent concept make her music as powerful as ever. Nothing short of an ambitious, late-age masterpiece, <strong>Let England Shake</strong> is, from the haunting melodies to the timeless &mdash; and time-jumping &mdash; subject matter, both an essential PJ Harvey album and arguably the first seminal war album. <em>Forrest Cardamenis</em></p>
<p>That&#39;s our take on a varied career, now how about yours? Any PJ Harvey highlights you&#39;d like to point us and the readers towards? We&#39;d love to hear your thoughts in the Disqus form below.</p>
