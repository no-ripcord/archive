<div>A mixtape is so much more than just a portable vessel for your favorite music. A&nbsp;deftly crafted mixtape is a work of art. Now, creating the perfect mixtape is an&nbsp;endeavor that has plagued mankind for decades. Done correctly, a mixtape will earn&nbsp;you legendary status among friends, and make and mend all relationships. But a poorly&nbsp;executed mixtape is as offensive as a slap to the face.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Making a good mixtape is a very subtle practice and takes a certain amount of skill.&nbsp;Needless to say, there are many dos and don&#39;ts. Here are some rules on creating the&nbsp;perfect mixtape&nbsp;to ensure you win the hearts of all who listen:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1) Always refer to it as a &quot;mixtape&quot;</strong>. One word, no spaces. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&#39;re making it on tape or on CD &ndash; always call it a &quot;mixtape&quot;. This is not just a case of semantics and word choice; it actually comes down to Basic English.&nbsp;Mixtape is a noun meaning &ldquo;a compilation of songs recorded in a specific&nbsp;order&rdquo;. Whereas if you call it a &quot;mix CD&quot;, a plain &quot;mix&quot; or even &quot;mix tape&quot; (with&nbsp;a space), you&#39;re giving it a whole different meaning. The word, &quot;mix&quot;, indicates&nbsp;randomness and an unsystematic blend. You are not creating a mix of songs;&nbsp;you are making a calculated selection. Plus, calling it a &quot;mixtape&quot; adds a nostalgic&nbsp;sense of romanticism since nobody really uses tapes anymore.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2) Know your target</strong>. A mixtape is a very personal thing, so don&rsquo;t make one for&nbsp;a stranger. You must know at least the bare essentials of their music taste&nbsp;(e.g. whether or not they like rap, or hate The White Stripes) before you&nbsp;begin their mixtape. For example, you&#39;re making a mixtape for a person&nbsp;you meet at the record store. You add a number of grunge songs based on&nbsp;their unkempt appearance, but it turns out this person is a diehard R&amp;B fan&nbsp;and finds your selection of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana loud and&nbsp;annoying. So do yourself a favor and get to know the person before making&nbsp;them a mixtape.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3) Have some knowledge of music</strong>. A mixtape is not something for the&nbsp;musically autistic. If your music taste is &ldquo;whatever is on the radio&rdquo;, then you&nbsp;probably shouldn&#39;t be making a mixtape. Seriously, nobody wants a mixtape full of Top 20 hits. If you add Justin Bieber or The Black Eyed Peas to your&nbsp;mixtape, you&#39;ll impress nobody.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4) Select a theme</strong>. Mixtapes should always be themed. You want there to be&nbsp;fluidity and cohesion &ndash; not just a random collection of songs. Using a theme&nbsp;throughout will unify the entire mixtape and make it feel so much more&nbsp;special then a selection of singles. Themes don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be&nbsp;complex; &ldquo;a few of my favorite songs&rdquo; is a theme that is basic, but will work.&nbsp;Usually themes relate to lyrics or song titles. A mixtape could be comprised&nbsp;of songs that have the word &ldquo;girl&rdquo; in the title, or songs about summertime. Another option is the genre mixtape, where all tracks are similar genres. The possibilities are endless.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5) Draft track listings</strong>. John Cusack&rsquo;s character in <strong>High Fidelity</strong> said, &ldquo;To me,&nbsp;making a tape is like writing a letter &mdash; there&#39;s a lot of erasing and rethinking&nbsp;and starting again.&rdquo;, and this is very true. You will not get it right first go.&nbsp;We have the luxury of dragging and reordering music in iTunes, so try a few&nbsp;different combinations before you select the &ldquo;Burn Disc&rdquo; button.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>6) Start and end with a bang</strong>. The first and last tracks are arguably the most&nbsp;important on your mixtape. The first sets everything up, and either draws&nbsp;your listener into your meticulously crafted world, or slams the door in their&nbsp;face. So start with a track you know they will love. You usually want to begin with an upbeat number, something with a catchy and infectious melody. The&nbsp;last track wraps up your whole selection of songs and leaves the listener with&nbsp;a final impression. You want the mixtape to feel complete, finished and whole&nbsp;&ndash; not like you just ran out of space. It is often good to use an epic, longer track&nbsp;that builds to a climactic finish. Just remember to choose songs that your&nbsp;listener will enjoy for first and last tracks, because these are the songs that&nbsp;will be remembered most.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>7) When in doubt, keep it short</strong>. There&#39;s nothing worse than a mixtape that&nbsp;overstays its welcome. You don&#39;t want to cram in tracks just to meet the 80-minute time limit on a CD. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with only having six songs&nbsp;on a mixtape &ndash; having six songs that flow and complement one another is far better&nbsp;than listing 18 songs that sound like they were thrown together with the precision of a double amputee.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>8) The rule of repeating artists</strong>. This has always been a very tough and&nbsp;controversial rule &ndash; whether or not to repeat artists on a mixtape. As a&nbsp;general rule, do not repeat the same artist more than once. But there are&nbsp;some exceptions. You can repeat artists if the entire mixtape is done in&nbsp;pairs of artists or if a track requires a following track (e.g. <em>Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s&nbsp;Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> should be followed by <em>With a Little Help From My&nbsp;Friends</em>). Also, it&#39;s okay to open and close with the same artist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>9) Mix it up</strong>. Despite what I said about not wanting a random selection of songs,&nbsp;it&#39;s no good making a mixtape of completely similar tracks; there needs to&nbsp;be some variety. If you have a song that is slow and morose, do not follow it&nbsp;by another equally depressing song. You don&#39;t want your listener getting&nbsp;bored (or suicidal) from too many slow, sad songs. So mix it up, but make&nbsp;sure there is still a steady and logical flow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>10) Always aim over your head</strong>. Giving a mixtape is all about creating an image&nbsp;of how musically educated you are. So try and make yourself seem more&nbsp;knowledgeable than you may be in reality. Give the impression that you have the largest&nbsp;record collection around. Subtly draw attention to a song&#39;s obscurities by using&nbsp;parenthetical qualifiers:&nbsp;e.g. (alternate take), (original edition), (extended&nbsp;cut). Feel free to use remixes&nbsp;and live versions of songs. It makes you seem more in the know, but also breathes new life into old favorites.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>11) Name your mixtape well</strong>. You should <em>always </em>name your mixtape, even if&nbsp;it is just <em><strong>So-and-so&rsquo;s Mixtape Vol. 1</strong></em> - it adds a personal touch to it. I would&nbsp;advise you to always add the words, &ldquo;Vol. 1&rdquo;, to the title of the first mixtape you make for someone. This shows that there are more mixtapes to come,&nbsp;which is an exciting prospect for a first time mixtape receiver. Naming your&nbsp;mixtape is also a good way to state the theme. One of the best mixtape titles I have ever seen is <em><strong>(T)rain</strong></em> &ndash; all the songs on the mixtape were either about&nbsp;trains or rain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>12) Create custom cover art</strong>. It is imperative to give your mixtape cover&nbsp;art. This is the first thing someone sees when receiving a mixtape and it&nbsp;immediately sets the tone for whatever music lies within. The phrase, &ldquo;you should never judge a book by its cover&rdquo;, does NOT apply here. You should definitely judge&nbsp;a mixtape by its cover. And be creative &ndash; don&#39;t just print out a picture of&nbsp;a cassette regardless of the irony factor. Whether you create it on your&nbsp;computer or by hand, a well-designed cover is essential for any mixtape.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>13) The giving of the mixtape</strong>. While you&#39;re handing over your completed&nbsp;mixtape to its lucky recipient, give hints on how hard you worked selecting the songs, or how long it took you to make it. Say things like, &ldquo;it took me over&nbsp;eleven attempts to get this mixtape just right&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;I was up until 3 a.m. finishing&nbsp;this for you&rdquo;. You want to give the impression that this mixtape took hours&nbsp;upon hours of concentration and hard work, even if it didn&rsquo;t.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>14) Ask for feedback</strong>. It&#39;s good to know what the person thought of their&nbsp;mixtape. It&rsquo;s important to find out which songs they loved and which songs&nbsp;they hated. This means next time you make them a mixtape, it will be even&nbsp;better tailored to fit their musical taste.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>15) And finally, never underestimate the power of a mixtape</strong>. Remember, you&#39;re using someone else&#39;s poetry to express how you feel. This is a delicate&nbsp;thing. If you&#39;re making a mixtape for a member of the opposite sex but have no intention&nbsp;of a relationship, don&#39;t use songs like <em>You&rsquo;re Beautiful</em>, <em>Sexual Healing</em> or <em>You Are the Sunshine of My Life</em> &ndash; it will probably send the wrong&nbsp;message. But on the other hand, if you do want to get together with this person, adding&nbsp;a few of the above tracks will give them a clue about how you feel. A mixtape is sometimes the best method of sensitive self-expression when it comes to the&nbsp;tangled intricacies of adolescent relationships.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now you have all the ingredients you need to create the perfect mixtape. Whether&nbsp;you want to get a girl, heal a broken friendship or give a thoughtful present &ndash; a&nbsp;mixtape is the perfect solution. So go ahead and start creating.</div>
