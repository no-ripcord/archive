  <div>Though we&#39;re yet to do it, can you imagine what a No Ripcord writers Christmas party would be like? It&#39;d probably consist of three dozen or so people having furious arguments about what music should be played before alcohol thaws our collective opinionated ways and our true festive spirit shines through. And what would we talk about? Well, the best and worst of the previous year of course! In the absence of such an event, here&#39;s the next best thing - we&#39;ve rounded up a motley crew (not actually&nbsp;<span word="Mötley" data-scaytid="1">Mötley</span> <span word="Crüe" data-scaytid="2">Crüe</span>, more&#39;s the pity) of writers and refused to leave them alone until they revealed what they thought about the period of time that critics worldwide are calling, &quot;2011&quot;.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>David Coleman (Editor-in-Chief)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: <span word="tUnE-yArDs" data-scaytid="4">tUnE-yArDs</span> - &quot;<em>W H O K I L L</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Apologies for being boring, but it&#39;s <em><span word="Bizness" data-scaytid="5">Bizness</span> </em>from the above record for me.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Rihanna. I couldn&#39;t be less interested in her if I tried.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Kurt Vile. I expected to hate his album [<strong>Smoke Ring For My Halo</strong>]; ended up loving it.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Fleet Foxes&#39; second record was good-not-great, but no real evidence of any progression. Also,&nbsp;Radiohead - I genuinely believe that <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> was their least interesting album since <strong>Pablo Honey</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Modern Family</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Not a great deal of competition in this category for me. The Horrors at Leeds Met <span word="Uni" data-scaytid="77">Uni</span> is about the only decent gig I can remember.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The unexpected release of Radiohead&#39;s <strong>The King of Limbs</strong>. By far the most interesting thing about the record, unfortunately, but it was another &quot;event release&quot; for the band.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2012</strong>:&nbsp;Rihanna to release another three albums, which will all consist of her warbling sexual innuendoes over bland, dance-tinged backing tracks. A&nbsp;New Romantic revival.&nbsp;The Stone Roses reunion shows to be a crushing disappointment.&nbsp;Andrew <span word="Baer" data-scaytid="7">Baer</span> to become a hate figure on Owl City fan sites. Oh hang on, that last one was 2011.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2011 in music in just one word</strong>: Middling</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="8">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez (Managing Editor)</u></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: <span word="PJ" data-scaytid="9">PJ</span> Harvey - <em>&quot;Let England Shake&quot;</em></div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: The Field&#39;s <em><span word="Arpeggiated" data-scaytid="10">Arpeggiated</span> Love</em>, followed by James Blake&#39;s <em>Wilhelm Scream</em> and Real Estate&#39;s <em>Municipality</em>.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: It was an incredible year for women in rock n&#39; roll. They&#39;re all my heroes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: John <span word="Maus" data-scaytid="13">Maus</span>, for writing one of the most tepid, mediocre albums in recent memory [<strong>We Must Become The Pitiless Censors Of Ourselves</strong>] and actually getting praise for it (and his humdrum philosophical musings). Cults as well, because I know it&#39;ll make our top 50 when it shouldn&#39;t even make a list of 200. Oh, and the duo Tennis made me feel poor with their precious story about being in love while taking the high seas in a boat...and writing an album about it.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: A.A. <span word="Bondy" data-scaytid="16">Bondy</span> shed his Dylan personification; <strong>Believers </strong>is actually quite great. Crystal Stilts became my new favorite friends after making some of the year&#39;s most irresistible fuzzy psychedelic pop. Cass <span word="McCombs" data-scaytid="17">McCombs</span> wrote not one but two very accomplished albums. And can someone explain to me why Cerebral <span word="Ballzy" data-scaytid="18">Ballzy</span> are so huge in the UK? And I am not ashamed to say this, but succumbing to like a bona-fide hipster album like Dirty Beaches&#39; <strong>Badlands </strong>so much.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: St. Vincent, but that&#39;s because my expectations were astronomical. Same goes for Atlas Sound - he usually releases incredible leftover material, but this [<strong>Parallax</strong>] just feels like leftovers; there comes a time when being so prolific will eventually bite you in the ass. Oh, and Six Organs of Admittance goes ignored...again; I&#39;d buy him a lollipop if I bump into him.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: It&#39;s too early to deem a winner (now&#39;s when it starts to get interesting), but my current front-runner is The Kid With A Bike, closely followed by The Tree Of Life, The Descendants and Take Shelter</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: I didn&#39;t see anything remarkable, I&#39;m afraid. Community<strong>&nbsp;</strong>never disappoints, though. It would&#39;ve probably been Mad Men had there been a season&nbsp;this year.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Guided by Voices were middle-aged depraved <span word="badasses" data-scaytid="28">badasses</span>, blowing all the youngsters I saw at <span word="FYF" data-scaytid="29">FYF</span> this year out of the water.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: While <span word="Julianna" data-scaytid="31">Julianna</span> <span word="Barwick" data-scaytid="32">Barwick</span> had me in a pleasurable trance midway through one of her songs, she accidentally hit stop on her micro loop monitor. Discovering the dawn of the new <span word="Iceage" data-scaytid="33">Iceage</span>.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2012</strong>: The new Lana del Rey will equally astound and frustrate. Judging by my lads&#39; enthusiasm, the xx will be the second best Album of the Year - and I still won&#39;t be impressed - followed by Animal Collective (if they construct a sound collage purely based on sneezing and armpit farts, it&#39;ll still be deemed a classic.)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Joe Rivers (Features Editor)</u></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: James Blake</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Everything <span word="Metronomy" data-scaytid="43">Metronomy</span> released from <strong>The English Riviera</strong> LP was great, but the correct answer here is the only track thus far to receive 10/10 on the No Ripcord Singles Bar - <em>Countdown </em>by <span word="Beyoncé" data-scaytid="48">Beyoncé</span>.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: It&#39;s a tie between Mario <span word="Balotelli" data-scaytid="49">Balotelli</span>&nbsp;and Nicola Roberts</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Rupert Murdoch, <span word="Rebekah" data-scaytid="50">Rebekah</span>&nbsp;Brooks, Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="51">Sheeran</span> - take your pick.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: The fact that anything I write on this site gets read at all is a constant source of astonishment.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: I really wanted Lady Gaga&#39;s <strong>Born This Way</strong> to be great, but it has to be Radiohead really, doesn&#39;t it?</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: George Harrison - Living In The Material World</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: I&#39;ve been entertained by Frozen Planet and the better-than-it-had-any-right-to-be Fresh Meat in 2011. Neither of them are Only Connect though, which wins.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: I saw Laura Marling perform in front of less than one hundred people at <span word="Maida" data-scaytid="272">Maida</span> Vale studios. It was spine-tinglingly good.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: The moment I saw Suede walk out at Latitude was pretty incredible. I also had a half hour phone conversation with Rebecca Taylor of Slow Club. Go me.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions of 2012</strong>: Big things for <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="53">Azealia</span> Banks, King <span word="Krule" data-scaytid="54">Krule</span> and <span word="StooShe" data-scaytid="55">StooShe</span>. Second albums by The xx and Little Boots to be amazing. Finally, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan to be frequently referenced by upcoming artists as important influences.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Boris - &quot;<em>Attention Please</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: <em>Hope </em>by Boris</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Tom Waits</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Lou Reed &amp; Metallica</div>

<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Radiohead&#39;s <strong>The King of Limbs</strong></div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: Super 8 (it made my inner Spielberg-addled child joyful)</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: Boardwalk Empire</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: J <span word="Mascis" data-scaytid="56">Mascis</span> at the World <span word="Café" data-scaytid="57">Café</span>, Philadelphia, PA</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: Probably the biggest music moment of the year was&nbsp;the death of Amy Winehouse. Otherwise, I couldn&#39;t give a fuck about <span word="Beyoncé’s" data-scaytid="58">Beyoncé&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;baby bump or Justin Bieber&rsquo;s paternity suit, which was likely doctored just so&nbsp;Bieber could claim the ownership of properly functioning male genitals.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2012</strong>:</div>
<div>a. The CD format will continue to thrive thanks to reissues; record labels&nbsp;move to reissue all of 2011&rsquo;s releases and hope people won&rsquo;t notice.</div>
<div>b. The Arcade Fire will be inducted into the Rock N&rsquo; Roll Hall of Fame.&nbsp;Kiss is snubbed again; Gene Simmons trademarks their twelfth loss.</div>
<div>c. Rock N&rsquo; Roll will be largely ignored; adult contemporary will continue to&nbsp;prosper.</div>
<div>d. Meg White will collaborate with Rebecca Black on a project called&nbsp;Whack. Jack White will be jealous he didn&rsquo;t think of it first.</div>
<div>e. Lou Reed won&rsquo;t take a hint and just stop.</div>
<div>f. Post-rock will sound like post-rock.</div>
<div>g. It will be admitted that Korn really did invent <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="59">dubstep</span>; the public will wise&nbsp;up and move on to some other trend.</div>
<div>h. Tyler, The Creator will find God and change his name to Preacher, For&nbsp;The Creator.</div>
<div>i. Kim Gordon won&rsquo;t have to change her name back to &ldquo;Gordon&rdquo; once the&nbsp;divorce goes through; Thurston Moore and Gordon symbolically issue a split 7.&rdquo;</div>
<div>j. A new online music resource will get sued.</div>
<div>k. Another online music resource will get sued.</div>
<div>l. Another online music resource will get sued.</div>
<div>m. The proprietor of an online music resource will realize it&rsquo;s cheaper to open&nbsp;a record store than have to deal with being sued.</div>
<div>n. Other proprietors of said sites will follow suit; a resurgence of&nbsp;independent record stores ensues.</div>
<div>o. Economic boom occurs; vinyl sales save the U.S. economy.</div>
<div>p. American public winds up too happy to appreciate Thom <span word="Yorke" data-scaytid="65">Yorke</span> anymore.</div>
<div>q. <span word="Yorke" data-scaytid="69">Yorke</span> quits Radiohead and tries acting.</div>
<div>r. <span word="Fugazi" data-scaytid="71">Fugazi</span> calls off its &ldquo;indefinite hiatus&rdquo; and charges $5.50 for reunion tour.&nbsp;Fans feel price gouged.</div>
<div>s. American public finds out that <span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="75">Kanye</span> West is actually CGI. Scandal becomes known as &ldquo;Westgate.&rdquo; George Lucas is held for questioning.</div>
<div>t. All of the Grammies go to Auto-tune and Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="78">Iver</span>.</div>
<div>u. All of the MTV Video Music Awards go to Auto-Tune and about a dozen&nbsp;topless dancers.</div>
<div>v. All of the Kids&#39; Choice Awards go to Katy Perry; millions of Dads tune&nbsp;in; ratings outdo Super Bowl.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2011 in music in just one word</strong>: Over.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Mark Davison (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;To be honest I&#39;m a bit surprised that &quot;<em>Metals</em>&quot; is my album of the year too (well, it would be a surprise if I hadn&#39;t already given it a 10/10 review). While 2011 offered up a fair few exciting, potentially groundbreaking records, none of them were quite so fully formed as <span word="Feist&#039;s" data-scaytid="79">Feist&#39;s</span> follow up to <strong>The Reminder</strong>. It&#39;s the only record I can think of this year where I wouldn&#39;t change a single thing.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Nicola Roberts - <em>Beat of my Drum</em>. At first I was convinced it was a novelty record, but it got better on subsequent listens (and, amazingly, still continues to do so).</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Aidan Moffat for his amazing Twitter feed, or <span word="Diplo" data-scaytid="80">Diplo</span> for being spectacularly lazy and recycling his old stuff, yet still coming up with two of the year&#39;s best songs as a result.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The British record buying public for ignoring some of the most ingenious pop records of the year (and Chris Brown, for being Chris Brown).</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Probably the Nicola Roberts album [<strong>Cinderella&#39;s Eyes</strong>]. Who knew she had it in her?</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Possibly the <span word="Zomby" data-scaytid="81">Zomby</span> album [<strong>Dedication</strong>]. Possibly the David Lynch one [<strong>Crazy Clown Time</strong>]. Possibly that, after a fair amount of hype in 2010, witch-house died an absolute death (that <span word="Balam" data-scaytid="82">Balam</span> <span word="Acab" data-scaytid="83">Acab</span> album [<strong>Wander/Wonder</strong>] was also pretty disappointing while I&#39;m on the subject).</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Drive - as a brutal deconstruction of the action genre it managed to both have its cake, and (by being a genuinely emotional, thrilling experience in its own right) eat it too.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;This is <span word="Jinsy" data-scaytid="84">Jinsy</span> - such delight in language in comedy hasn&#39;t been seen since the days of Spike Milligan, the <span word="handbuilt" data-scaytid="85">handbuilt</span> sets were adorable, and the songs were amazing (if they&#39;d released an album it would have been in my top 15 albums of the year for sure). It&#39;s everything The Mighty <span word="Boosh" data-scaytid="86">Boosh</span> should have been but never was. Shame that it&#39;s been tucked away on Sky Atlantic so that barely anybody gets to see it (actually, the same applies for the second best TV show of the year - Game of Thrones).</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;<span word="Sufjan" data-scaytid="87">Sufjan</span> Stevens at the Royal Festival Hall - an energetic, exhausting and ridiculous two and half hours, that was worth the five year wait.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The typically playful announcement on Twitter of Pulp&#39;s reunion.</div>
<div><strong>Music Predictions for 2012</strong>:&nbsp;Having spent the last few weeks buried in <span word="Skyrim" data-scaytid="89">Skyrim</span> on the PlayStation, I&#39;m really hoping that somebody has the idea to combine <span word="Wagnerian" data-scaytid="90">Wagnerian</span> orchestrations with <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="88">dubstep</span>/hip-hop. It&#39;s a bit of a long shot though. Realistically, instead, I expect that we&#39;ll see a rise in well-meaning but uninformed protest songs from middle class kids with guitars, and that there&#39;ll probably be a bit of a backlash to greet the release of The xx&#39;s second album, just because.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Album Of The Year</strong>: Nicolas <span word="Jaar" data-scaytid="108">Jaar</span> - &quot;<em>Space Is Only Noise</em>&quot;. It&rsquo;s a record like no other, one that seamlessly meshes samples and live instrumentation, one with almost no lyrics but surprising emotional depth. It&#39;s often the little things that stand out, like how&nbsp;the claps decay at different rates at different times in <em>Keep Me There</em>, or the chopped guitars in <em>Specters&nbsp;of the Future</em>. The whole record fits seamlessly together, jumping from one trickling, unidentified sound&nbsp;to another. It&#39;s full of mystery, but nothing this year managed to sound so familiar.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Destroyer&rsquo;s <strong><span word="Kaputt" data-scaytid="109">Kaputt</span> </strong>is Dan <span word="Bejar" data-scaytid="110">Bejar</span> at his surreal best, with brilliant songwriting throughout. The&nbsp;title track is a shining example, an easy, quick listen, a strange song wrapped in a perfectly simple&nbsp;melody. His off key singing fits the moment perfectly, and it just makes sense that he&rsquo;d be chasing&nbsp;cocaine through the back rooms of the world. Alright.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Julian <span word="Assange" data-scaytid="111">Assange</span>.&nbsp;The cables didn&rsquo;t hold all that much great information, but it&rsquo;s the thought that counts. It pissed&nbsp;off the US government and showed Obama to be an accountability hypocrite, someone who talks a lot but doesn&rsquo;t back it up. He&rsquo;s sparking a rising interest in holding them accountable.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Penn State.&nbsp;This is easier than the hero, because I spent most of my time hating stuff. My girlfriend and I&nbsp;came up with at least ten villains and only about three heroes. I was going to list Marcus Mumford&nbsp;because I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing how fucking great his music is when it&rsquo;s terrible, but he wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;involved in child rape. In the end, that&rsquo;s a whole lot worse than making overrated music.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Low has released a string of mediocre records, but <strong><span word="C’Mon" data-scaytid="112">C&rsquo;Mon</span></strong> was pretty solid. It was a highly&nbsp;enjoyable return to form, and did it without sounding like a rehash.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: <span word="Micachu" data-scaytid="113">Micachu</span> and the Shapes&#39; <strong>Chopped and Screwed</strong>.&nbsp;I loved <span word="Micachu’s" data-scaytid="114">Micachu&rsquo;s</span> debut record, and this was a big drop in quality. I had high hopes for the&nbsp;orchestral collaborations, but it just didn&rsquo;t work out.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: Cowboys and Aliens.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t see many movies this year, but most things with Harrison Ford are the shit. At one point,&nbsp;he was Han Solo. And Indiana Jones.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>: Parks and Recreation&nbsp;went from having a pretty bad first season with a great cast, to having a solid second season&nbsp;into an absolutely stellar third. Every character hit their stride, and the TV comedy with the most&nbsp;potential finally started to reach it.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: Godspeed You! Black Emperor at the <span word="Showbox" data-scaytid="115">Showbox</span> <span word="Sodo" data-scaytid="116">Sodo</span>, Seattle, Washington. I saw them in late February, on a dark, rainy night. The perfect setting for a fantastic show. They used almost no lights, no features beyond the incredible music. They just played, and did so perfectly.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: James Blake making fun of <span word="brostep" data-scaytid="117">brostep</span>.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a genre I hear a lot of and only enjoy at parties, and I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about <span word="Skrillex" data-scaytid="118">Skrillex</span>. James&nbsp;Blake took it down a peg or two.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2012</strong>:&nbsp;I think <span word="chillwave" data-scaytid="121">chillwave</span> will continue to be diluted to the point of dying out, and I can&rsquo;t say I mind. It&nbsp;sounds like the genre has run its course. R&amp;B tinted electronic music will continue its rise, and more artists like James Blake, Jamie <span word="Woon" data-scaytid="122">Woon</span> and The <span word="Weeknd" data-scaytid="123">Weeknd</span> will appear. Dance-infused <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="119">dubstep</span> will continue&nbsp;its rise in the mainstream. Music will continue its transition, and new artists will keep rising. In 2011 the&nbsp;old guard let us all down, with artists like TV On The Radio, Radiohead, and Panda Bear put out albums&nbsp;that were solid but not nearly as good as we wanted.</div>

<div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Junior Boys - &quot;<em>It&#39;s All True</em>&quot;. No grand statement; just a pitch-perfect return to form. Easily the most fun I had between my headphones all year.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: The Weather Station - <em>Came So Easy</em>. (First song to make me tear up in years.)</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Ghostly International. Their merging of <span word="electronica" data-scaytid="221">electronica</span> into post-classical (on the compilation <strong><span word="SMM" data-scaytid="222">SMM</span>: Context</strong>) guided my year in music-listening.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: I won&#39;t indulge my knee-jerk reaction, which would have me calling out <span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="223">Kanye</span> West. Honestly, &quot;villains&quot; in music merely represent differences in taste. So instead I&#39;ll call out the jackasses who robbed over $24,000 worth of gear from <span word="Mogwai" data-scaytid="226">Mogwai</span>.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Besides <span word="Jesu" data-scaytid="227">Jesu</span> owning the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%232" target="_blank">#2</a> spot on my Top Albums list? Independent rock going soft-rock.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: That Boards Of Canada haven&#39;t updated their website since the summer of 2006. Seriously.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: I&#39;d say Radiohead&#39;s Live From the Basement taping. And I haven&#39;t even seen it, but the audio of that show is more than enough proof for me. Also, it seems to have helped a lot of eye-rolling <strong>King Of Limbs</strong> pundits see the light.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year</strong>: Again, I have to give Radiohead their due. As they had done with <strong>In Rainbows</strong>, their lead-up to <strong>The King Of Limbs</strong> had everybody watching their <span word="inboxes" data-scaytid="231">inboxes</span> and waiting to experience new music in a communal way. Whether the record itself lived up to that hype or not doesn&#39;t negate the old school power of exploring an anticipated piece of music en masse.&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Tough one to answer, but I&#39;ll say Kate Bush. To come out with her first new album in 18 years and to do it so well is a great achievement.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Bruno Mars. I do not advocate eugenics, but if our overlords said it was absolutely necessary for the good of humankind, I&#39;d take their word for it and volunteer him and his fans.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Latitude Festival&#39;s lineup looked like one of the worst (on paper) I&#39;ve seen in the four years I&#39;ve been going, but turned out to be my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="245">favourite</span> so far.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The <span word="Decemberists" data-scaytid="253">Decemberists</span>. They&#39;re by far my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="250">favourite</span> band, but <strong>The King Is Dead</strong> lost pretty much all of the playful inventiveness that made them great. It worked for them commercially, though.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: I&#39;m rubbish with films - don&#39;t think I even visited a cinema this year! I finally watched Blade Runner though - can I say that?</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm was pretty, pretty, pretty good... as ever.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: I was seriously impressed by Caribou at Latitude Festival this year.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The bit in <em>The A Team</em> by Ed <span word="Sheeran" data-scaytid="264">Sheeran</span> where he describes someone&#39;s face as <em>&quot;crumbling like pastries&quot;</em>. He is trolling us all with similes like that.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2012</strong>: I&#39;ve noticed electronic music has been making more and more of an impact over the last few years, so I&#39;d expect to see more of that. I&#39;m particularly looking forward to the new Flying Lotus record.</div>

<div><u>David Wood</u></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Gang Gang Dance - &quot;<em>Eye Contact</em>&quot;.&nbsp;Should be to 2011 what <strong><span word="Merriweather" data-scaytid="295">Merriweather</span> Post Pavilion</strong> was to 2009. But it probably won&#39;t be.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Burial - <em>Street Halo</em>. Four years after <strong>Untrue</strong>, Burial returns with his finest track, marrying his trademark shadowy vocal samples to an almost tribal trance rhythm. Takes this genre of music to a new level.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;<span word="Björk" data-scaytid="296">Björk</span>, for at least trying something new with this <span word="new-fangled" data-scaytid="297">new-fangled</span> technology.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;The faceless taste-maker who decided that <span word="80s" data-scaytid="298">80s</span> <span word="synth-pop" data-scaytid="299">synth-pop</span> deserved to be resurrected in cool new clothes</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>:&nbsp;Two new albums by Kate Bush. And they&#39;re both good.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: The Jeff <span word="Mangum-curated" data-scaytid="300">Mangum-curated</span> ATP is postponed until March. Speculation is rife of a double booking blunder involving a 90s boy-band weekend.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Radiohead&#39;s &#39;surprise&#39; appearance at Glastonbury</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: The moment six minutes into <em>Glass Jar</em>, track 1 of <strong>Eye Contact</strong>, when the <span word="synth" data-scaytid="301">synth</span> riff and drums kick in. A wave of musical joy unsurpassed all year.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2012</strong>:&nbsp;The charts become less relevant than ever as Rihanna releases a single a day.

<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Jenny <span word="Hval" data-scaytid="305">Hval</span> - &quot;<em>Viscera</em>&quot;. It isn&rsquo;t for everyone &ndash; it&rsquo;s an ambient-folk exploration of sexuality and the body &ndash; but I found it beautiful and terrifying; it&rsquo;s a unique and powerful example of the possibilities of the music album format.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: <em>Video Games</em> by Lana Del Rey is still as amazing as it was before the backlash.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Merrill <span word="Garbus" data-scaytid="307">Garbus</span> (<span word="tUnE-yArDs" data-scaytid="306">tUnE-yArDs</span>) made one of the year&rsquo;s best albums, put on a jubilant live show, and is one of the most innovative artists to achieve recognition this year.</div>
