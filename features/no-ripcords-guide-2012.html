  <div>So, 2012, pretty much done and dusted, isn&#39;t it? But it&#39;s been a good year, all told. R&amp;B and hip-hop records have permeated the indie-centric critical landscape, <span word="mixtapes" data-scaytid="197">mixtapes</span>&nbsp;are becoming ever-more mainstream and, against all odds, <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="204">lo-fi</span> garage rock <span word="soundtracked" data-scaytid="213">soundtracked</span> the year for many an enthusiastic music aficionado. And that&#39;s the year in a nutshell without mentioning <em>that </em>Death Grips album cover. We had a blast in 2012 and hope you did too, so before the year is out, here&#39;s what we thought of the past 366 days in handy survey form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>David Coleman (Editor-in-Chief)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Kendrick Lamar - &quot;<em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Sharon van <span word="Etten&#039;s" data-scaytid="1">Etten&#39;s</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exJ3AG0JIeo"><em>Give Out</em></a> - a beautiful song.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Chris Brown.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Fiona Apple. I didn&#39;t expect to enjoy her record, let alone love it enough to place it <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%232" target="_blank">#2</a> on my end of year list. Also, Little Mix&#39;s <em>Wings </em>which unexpectedly made it onto my Tracks of the Year list.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: The latest Shins album was particularly dreadful, but I&#39;d like to single out the Mercury Music Prize for picking the worst shortlist - and the blandest winner - in recent memory.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: At the cinema, it has to be <em><span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="2">Skyfall</span> </em>for me. I caught an IMAX screening and was blown away. Not without its faults, but the best Bond movie I&#39;ve seen. At home, my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="3">favourite</span> was a bloodthirsty Korean revenge film called <em>The Man From Nowhere</em>.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: A toss-up between <em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Sharon van <span word="Etten" data-scaytid="4">Etten</span> at Queen&#39;s Social Club in Sheffield was breathtaking at times. &quot;<em>Tramp</em>&quot; really came to life in this setting.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: On a personal note, the performance of <em>Give Out</em> at the aforementioned Sharon van <span word="Etten" data-scaytid="5">Etten</span> gig was genuinely amazing - the single best live performance I&#39;ve witnessed this decade. On a more general note, the Olympic opening ceremony was a fantastic achievement.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2013</strong>: I&#39;m going to stick with last year&#39;s prediction, which seemed to come true this year, and will no doubt happen all over again in 2013: &quot;Rihanna to release another three albums, which will all consist of her warbling sexual innuendoes over bland, dance-tinged backing tracks.&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in music in just one word</strong>: Olympic.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="7">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez (Managing Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Fiona Apple - &quot;<em>The Idler Wheel...</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Perfume Genius&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOpkr8uNWpk"><em>Hood</em></a>. Sing with me: <em>&quot;You would never call me <span word="baaaby" data-scaytid="8">baaaby</span>&quot;</em>.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: The band fun., who aren&#39;t that fun to listen to, are they? And the beloved Mumford barber quartet of course, because their &quot;authentic-ness&quot; won the hearts of many people I thought had better taste in music. And finally, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to every ear-bleeding LA folk band I had the obligation of listening to for work purposes. LA faux-bohemians with your export coffee and nauseating, purposely misspelled <span word="catchphrases" data-scaytid="9">catchphrases</span>, I hate you; how did you become so self-consciously hip all of a sudden? As you might tell, I&#39;ve got many, many villains.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: One Direction conquered American shores in a big way! I always seem to forget that teens and children will never tire of the standard boy band set-up, but then there&#39;s also the fact that I sometimes forget that people were actually born after 1990. Major news outlets got the memo about electronic music triumphing over rock n&#39; roll. Wasn&#39;t this actual news in 2011? By 2013, major news outlets will also warn us about the K-pop invasion and the Christian indie rock takeover. No one took Kindness seriously - ha! But that&#39;s so ironic.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Too many established acts took the word &quot;established&quot; to heart by releasing stale comfort food. I&#39;m looking at you: Beach House, Field Music, Tallest Man on Earth, Nada Surf, Mission of Burma. <em>*shakes fist in rage*</em> I&#39;m not a fan of Mac&#39; and Cheese, guys.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: I&#39;m between the following: <em>Monsieur <span word="Lazhar" data-scaytid="10">Lazhar</span></em>, <em>The Kid with a Bike</em> and <em>Le <span word="Havre" data-scaytid="11">Havre</span></em>. Strictly American releases? Perhaps between <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> and <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em>. I haven&#39;t seen <em>Amour </em>yet, but I hope it rocks my world.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>: I&#39;m kind of ashamed to say this, but I didn&#39;t feel passionate about any TV show this year.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: A tie between Dinosaur <span word="Jr" data-scaytid="12">Jr</span>. and The Field at this year&#39;s <span word="FYF" data-scaytid="13">FYF</span> Festival.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year</strong>: This is still fresh in my mind since it happened so recently, but I still find it quite disturbing that the name Nirvana got resurrected, and to add insult to injury, got thrown around so freely without the presence of Kurt <span word="Cobain" data-scaytid="14">Cobain</span>. Why not call it McCartney and half of the <span word="Foo" data-scaytid="15">Foo</span> Fighters, or McCartney and the former members of Nirvana? Frankly, my dear, it gave me the chills.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Prediction for 2013</strong>: Some new digital music service that will merge image with sound will revolutionize the way we listen to music. <span word="Instagram" data-scaytid="16">Instagram</span> will probably be responsible for 50% of the deal, thus inserting the fetish of crappy, arbitrarily-filtered picture taking into the album experience. Grimes will be the spokeswoman. Every genre in music will get experimental, yet I&#39;ll be happy because a few <span word="untrendy" data-scaytid="17">untrendy</span> &quot;<span word="ol’" data-scaytid="18">ol&rsquo;</span> reliables&quot; will release stellar albums. The <span word="60s" data-scaytid="19">60s</span> will become the new <span word="80s" data-scaytid="20">80s</span>, which had previously become the <span word="90s" data-scaytid="21">90s</span>... and then we&#39;ll run out of decades. And finally, it&#39;s time to start ordering cocktails again because exotica is making a comeback! Mark my words.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in music in just one word</strong>: Exhausting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Joe Rivers (Features Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: I <span word="realise" data-scaytid="22">realise</span> this puts me in a very small minority, but &quot;<em>Purple Naked Ladies</em>&quot; by The Internet</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Leo Zero&rsquo;s reworking of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/leo-zero/friends-friend-crush-leo-zero"><em>Friend Crush</em></a> by Friends is the <span word="70s" data-scaytid="23">70s</span> disco classic that never was.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Frank Ocean and Pussy Riot</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Chris Brown, obviously. But if we look outside of the world of music... it&rsquo;s still Chris Brown to be honest. And the people behind the Daily Mail, especially Liz <span word="“Jizz" data-scaytid="24">&ldquo;Jizz</span> Loans&rdquo; Jones.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: It may have been for one night only, but I don&rsquo;t think many people thought Paul McCartney would effectively join Nirvana.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Just when artists had found a way to reconnect with their fans, build a relationship with them and perhaps answer the riddle of art versus commerce, Amanda Palmer and <span word="Deakin" data-scaytid="25">Deakin</span> from Animal Collective had to go and ruin it for everyone. Oh, and <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="26">Azealia</span> Banks and A$AP Rocky delaying their records until next year.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>Looper</em></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: Why it&rsquo;s taken me ten series to become addicted to <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> is a mystery to me. The second series of <em>Fresh Meat</em> was pretty amazing too. However, I know I&rsquo;m obsessed with a show when I start <span word="Googling" data-scaytid="27">Googling</span> the participants&rsquo; names for pointless trivia about them, and that&rsquo;s what I did with <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: The most fun I had at a performance in 2012 was seeing Sister Sledge at <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="28">Bestival</span>. That&rsquo;s me, always on the cusp of what&rsquo;s hot, fresh and new.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: I&rsquo;d waited nearly two decades to see Blur do <em><span word="Parklife" data-scaytid="29">Parklife</span> </em>and when they did, Harry Enfield was on stage with them &ndash; I practically had a <span word="90sgasm" data-scaytid="30">90sgasm</span>. However, you haven&rsquo;t lived until you&rsquo;ve stood in a field with thousands of people, watching Stevie Wonder and chanting the opening horn riff to <em>Sir Duke</em>.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions of 2013</strong>: Trap to be big. 2-step to make something of a comeback. Angel Haze should be pretty big. <span word="Charli" data-scaytid="31">Charli</span> <span word="XCX" data-scaytid="32">XCX</span> to be the British Grimes. A*M*E to make a dent on the pop charts. K- and J-pop to become more of a noticeable influence on music made around the world. <span word="Haim" data-scaytid="33">Haim</span> to have a Top 5 album. <span word="Deap" data-scaytid="34">Deap</span> Valley to excite rock critics the world over. <span word="Vaporwave" data-scaytid="35">Vaporwave</span> to make the early stages of a breakthrough and become the sound of young <span word="Dalston" data-scaytid="36">Dalston</span>. Really though, if 2013 doesn&rsquo;t see <span word="AlunaGeorge" data-scaytid="37">AlunaGeorge</span> become the biggest band in the entire world then we, as a species, are doing something fundamentally wrong.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in music in just one word</strong>: <span word="Mélange" data-scaytid="38">Mélange</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Mark Davison (Film &amp; TV Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Death Grips &ndash; &quot;<em>The Money Store</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Lana Del Rey &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxyWe6K5MEg"><em>Born To Die</em></a> (<span word="Woodkid" data-scaytid="39">Woodkid</span> &amp; The Shoes Remix)</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: The guys at <a href="http://www.pieandvinyl.co.uk/">Pie &amp; Vinyl</a> in Portsmouth, not just for finally giving the city a decent record store at a time when many others are being forced to close, but for also going out of their way to help make its live music scene considerably more interesting, and for always being happy to chat about records (or pies), even when they weren&rsquo;t taking all of my money.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: The sizeable segments of the audience at the Magnetic Fields&rsquo; and Godspeed You! Black Emperor&rsquo;s London shows who would not shut the fuck up, even during the quiet bits.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: The &lsquo;release&rsquo; of &quot;<em>No Love Deep Web</em>.&quot; A bit of a shame that Death Grips essentially committed career suicide for an album that was only ok, but the resulting drama was fun to follow and hey, at least it was free. &nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: &nbsp;Considering it took him well over a year to put five tracks together, I was expecting a bit more of <span word="oOoOO’s" data-scaytid="40">oOoOO&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;&quot;<em>Our Loving Is Hurting Us EP</em>.&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em><span word="Berberian" data-scaytid="41">Berberian</span> Sound Studio</em></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: Adam Buxton&rsquo;s <em>BUG!</em> (it turns out Murdoch&rsquo;s most diabolical plan was to silence his critics with a stream of quality shows &ndash; see also: <em>Mad Men</em> season 5; <em><span word="Moone" data-scaytid="42">Moone</span> Boy</em>; <em>Girls </em>etc. etc.).</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Probably <span word="Planningtorock" data-scaytid="43">Planningtorock</span> at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, although Purity Ring&#39;s show at the <span word="Scala" data-scaytid="44">Scala</span> was also pretty damn great.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: It&rsquo;s got to be that Frank Ocean <a href="https://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/26473798723"><span word="tumblr" data-scaytid="45">tumblr</span> post</a>, hasn&rsquo;t it?</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2013</strong>: Following the unlikely success of Jake <span word="Bugg" data-scaytid="50">Bugg</span>, <span word="skiffle" data-scaytid="51">skiffle</span> makes a massive comeback. On a related note: I finally <span word="realise" data-scaytid="46">realise</span> that I&rsquo;m too old to even attempt to understand whatever it is that &lsquo;the kids&rsquo; are into these days. Also, <span word="AlunaGeorge" data-scaytid="47">AlunaGeorge</span> will release a properly amazing debut album.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in music in just one word</strong><span>: Expensive</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Andrew <span word="Baer" data-scaytid="54">Baer</span> (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Kendrick Lamar &ndash; &quot;<em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>.&quot; Pitchfork&rsquo;s high rating almost made me stop liking it because it&rsquo;s not cool to like things Pitchfork does anymore, but it&rsquo;s just too good.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Bat for Lashes &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UznHTBZIa8E"><em>Laura</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: James Bond, because <em><span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="55">Skyfall</span> </em>was badass.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Todd Akin. Not only was the &ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo; comment stupid, but it exposed the awful state of science education in America. I mean c&rsquo;mon, that&rsquo;s incredibly basic biology/sex <span word="ed" data-scaytid="57">ed</span>. Of course women can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;shut all that stuff off.&rdquo;</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Kendrick Lamar</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Spiritualized live at the Sasquatch Festival. I was so excited and it sucked so much.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em><span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="58">Skyfall</span></em>. I&rsquo;ve got a thing for Bond.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>: <em>Breaking Bad</em>. Breaking Bad Breaking Bad Breaking Bad! I like watching <em>The League</em> because it&rsquo;s funny and crass, but BB has to be one of the best written and best acted television shows of all time.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: <span word="Japandroids" data-scaytid="60">Japandroids</span>. I saw them twice in the same venue, and they played 2+ hours each time. Not because it was planned, but because they were having so much fun with genuinely exceptional crowds.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year</strong>: It&rsquo;s a small one, but hearing Ty <span word="Segall" data-scaytid="61">Segall</span> yell, <em>&ldquo;FUCK YEAH!&rdquo;</em>, at the end of <em>Wave Goodbye</em> off &quot;<em>Slaughterhouse</em>.&quot; It&rsquo;s a small but powerful moment of joy.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Predictions of 2013</strong>: R&amp;B albums will continue to be lauded by critics. People in Seattle will continue to love <span word="Macklemore" data-scaytid="62">Macklemore</span> and I will continue to wonder why.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in Music in One Word</strong>: Eclectic</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Forrest <span word="Cardamenis" data-scaytid="63">Cardamenis</span> (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Frank Ocean &ndash; &quot;<em>Channel Orange</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Frank Ocean &ndash; <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s26qTrH2atA">Pyramids</a>&nbsp;</em><span>(video <span word="NSFW" data-scaytid="65">NSFW</span>)</span></div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Everyone who contributed to making Amanda Palmer agree to pay all of her musicians; Death Grips, for being utterly insane; <span word="Japandroids" data-scaytid="64">Japandroids</span>, for <span word="soundtracking" data-scaytid="67">soundtracking</span> a brilliant summer for me and certainly lots of other people</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: I figured it would be hard to beat Amanda Palmer after she decided that some of her performing musicians weren&rsquo;t worth paying, but then Wayne <span word="Coyne" data-scaytid="68">Coyne</span> took a grenade into the airport and had no remorse for anyone who was inconvenienced or had to spend money on a new ticket. So, congratulations Wayne <span word="Coyne" data-scaytid="69">Coyne</span>. Also: Death Grips, for being utterly insane.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Godspeed dropped an album Radiohead style, so that was pretty unexpected; even I, maybe the biggest Bruce fan I know, didn&rsquo;t think he had an album as good as &quot;<em>Wrecking Ball</em>&quot; still in him; pleased to meet you, Screaming Females, I never would have guessed that you would make the best rock album of the year.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Titus <span word="Andronicus’s" data-scaytid="70">Andronicus&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;&quot;<em>The Monitor</em>&quot; is, to this critic, the best punk album since &quot;<em>Let It Be</em>&quot;, but follow-up &quot;<em>Local Business</em>&quot; is nothing more than a pretty good album. Not &quot;<em>Centipede Hz.</em>,&quot; no matter what anyone else says</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>Amour </em>and <em>Holy Motors</em> are two completely different kinds of masterpieces, but they&rsquo;re easily the two best films of the year.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: I didn&rsquo;t watch anything this year, really. Ask me next year.</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Any year that Bruce Springsteen is on tour means that all the best performances of the year are from the same guy. Having attended seven of his eight NY/NJ shows this year, the final trio at MetLife Stadium showcased the greatest live performer in the history of rock music at the top of his game. Among the three it&rsquo;s impossible to pick one, but those three were far and away the best shows I attended all year. But if this has to be a single performance, seeing Dinosaur <span word="Jr" data-scaytid="71">Jr</span>. play <em>The Boy With The Thorn In His Side</em> with Johnny Marr was pretty special. At the same time, my girlfriend and I were invited personally by <span word="Japandroids" data-scaytid="73">Japandroids</span> to attend their hometown (Vancouver, BC) show. I&rsquo;ll never forget that.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: The above <span word="Japandroids" data-scaytid="75">Japandroids</span> experience; Death Grips releasing &quot;<em>No Love Deep Web</em>&quot; and the ensuing fallout with Epic; <em>Pyramids</em>. Listening to it for the first time. And the next time. And that time again, just a couple hours ago.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2013</strong>: I suggested this last year, but I&rsquo;ll do it again: Arcade Fire makes the album of the year.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in music in just one word</strong>: Unpredictable</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="77">Wragg</span> (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Kendrick Lamar - &quot;<em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Angel Haze - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7bZ08RNUyM"><em>Cleaning Out My Closet</em></a> (trigger warning: rape) makes me break down. It is an important song which I feel speaks for itself.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: The <span word="Crutchfield" data-scaytid="78">Crutchfield</span> twins (Katie and Allison) have made two sorely underrated, emotionally staggering albums (with &quot;<em><span word="Waxahatchee" data-scaytid="79">Waxahatchee</span></em>&quot; and &quot;<em><span word="Swearin" data-scaytid="80">Swearin</span>&#39;</em>&quot; respectively)</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Surfer Blood, whose <span word="frontman" data-scaytid="81">frontman</span> was arrested for domestic abuse, and it would be tragic if this was swept under the rug next year when they make their major label debut.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: the &quot;<em>No Love Deep Web</em>&quot; cover showing up on my mp3 player</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Our editor David Coleman gave it an 8, but I thought Ariel Pink&#39;s &quot;<em>Mature Themes</em>&quot; was utterly vapid nonsense, and I loved &quot;<em>Before Today</em>.&quot;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Andrew <span word="Ciraulo" data-scaytid="99">Ciraulo</span></u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Titus <span word="Andronicus" data-scaytid="100">Andronicus</span> - &quot;<em>Local Business</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: This might seem a bit repetitive, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxrIp5huTHs"><em><span word="Ecce" data-scaytid="101">Ecce</span> Homo</em></a> (also off &quot;<em>Local Business</em>&quot;) has kind of become my own personal anthem.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Ty <span word="Segall" data-scaytid="102">Segall</span> put out three stellar albums, a bunch of singles, and toured relentlessly, both in the States and internationally. If that sort of work ethic doesn&rsquo;t earn you Time <span word="Magazineʼs" data-scaytid="104">Magazineʼs</span> Person Of The Year, it should at least grant you a mention on my list.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Mike Love for essentially breaking up The Beach Boys twice. That man must be made of orphans&rsquo; tears, Wal-Mart gift cards, and <span word="Satanʼs" data-scaytid="105">Satanʼs</span> pubic hair to be that evil. I hate you, Mike Love. I really, really do.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: Speaking of Mike Love, <span word="Iʼd" data-scaytid="106">Iʼd</span> have to say that the Beach <span word="Boysʼ" data-scaytid="107">Boysʼ</span> &ldquo;reunion&rdquo; record was the biggest disappointment this year. <span word="Itʼs" data-scaytid="108">Itʼs</span> not that I expected some sort of comeback album that would trump every other record in the <span word="bandʼs" data-scaytid="109">bandʼs</span> <span word="proliﬁc" data-scaytid="110">proliﬁc</span> discography, but I did expect a decent Brian Wilson solo effort at least. Instead we got pitch-corrected Beach Boy harmonies and pathetic, outdated songs about cruising down the coastline while listening to Top 40 radio.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>The Master</em></div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>: <em>Breaking Bad</em> takes my top spot, but it is by no means a slide victory. Other shows like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, and <em>Louis </em>were absolutely <span word="magniﬁcent" data-scaytid="111">magniﬁcent</span>, and are more than deserving of an <span word="honourable" data-scaytid="112">honourable</span> mention.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: The Mountain Goats and The Anonymous 4 at The <span word="Merkin" data-scaytid="113">Merkin</span> Concert Hall in New York City.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year</strong>: <span word="Iʼd" data-scaytid="114">Iʼd</span> say interviewing Patrick Stickles and R. Stevie Moore was pretty damn cool. <span word="Thereʼs" data-scaytid="116">Thereʼs</span> a brief moment before you meet one of your heroes where the notion that they might not live up to your fantastic expectations does pop into your head. Fortunately for me, Stickles and Moore are both nice, patient people with a whole lot to say! I am sincerely grateful that they took time out of their busy schedules to talk to an inquisitive <span word="fanboy" data-scaytid="117">fanboy</span> like myself.</div>
<div><strong>Music Predictions for 2013</strong>: Some good releases, some bad releases, some horrendous releases &ndash; business as usual really. Arcade Fire will probably come out with a decent/good album <span word="thatʼll" data-scaytid="118">thatʼll</span> probably get another Grammy nomination/win. Justin Bieber, The Wanted, and One Direction will continue making awful records for pre-teen girls and sad, middle-aged women to buy. Billie Joe Armstrong will make a miraculous recovery after a brief stint in rehab. Green <span word="Dayʼs" data-scaytid="119">Dayʼs</span> new album will be lauded as a &ldquo;return to form&rdquo; and sell millions of copies, even though <span word="itʼs" data-scaytid="120">itʼs</span> quite awful. <span word="Coheed" data-scaytid="121">Coheed</span> and Cambria will release another terrible record that will successfully smother my inner thirteen year-old. Vinyl record sales will continue to increase. Coincidentally, the amount of musicians sporting ironic <span word="moustaches" data-scaytid="122">moustaches</span> and designer shirts with the word &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; printed on them will triple.</div>
<div><strong>Sum up 2012 in Music in just one word</strong>: Fuzzy</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Joe <span word="Marvilli" data-scaytid="123">Marvilli</span></u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Bat for Lashes &ndash; &quot;<em>The Haunted Man</em>&quot;</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Bat for Lashes &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UznHTBZIa8E"><em>Laura</em></a>, followed by Sharon Van <span word="Etten" data-scaytid="124">Etten</span> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYgyQ20TJAs"><em>Serpents</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Women for pretty much running the year in music in all genres. Fifteen out of my Top 20 albums of the year were fronted by an indie female. Throw in Taylor Swift and Adele&rsquo;s continued pop dominance and you have the strongest year for women in music since&hellip; well&hellip; ever.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Carly Rae <span word="Jepsen" data-scaytid="126">Jepsen</span> for ruining the four-month run of fun, and <span word="Gotye" data-scaytid="127">Gotye</span> topping the U.S. Billboard Charts. It&rsquo;s like getting a ray of sunshine and then getting struck by lightning.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Grimes for making the best electronic album since LCD <span word="Soundsystem" data-scaytid="128">Soundsystem</span> hung it up. I don&rsquo;t normally buy <span word="electronica" data-scaytid="129">electronica</span> but this record is too good to pass up.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: This one&rsquo;s a tie as both Damon <span word="Albarn" data-scaytid="130">Albarn</span> and Andrew Bird released pretty middling albums with a couple of really great first singles. I love <em>Apple Carts</em> off &quot;<em>Dr. Dee</em>&quot; and <em><span word="Eyeoneye" data-scaytid="131">Eyeoneye</span> </em>off &quot;<em>Break It Yourself</em>&quot;. The rest though? Not so much.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Yes, I know it&rsquo;s flawed. No, it doesn&rsquo;t change my decision in the slightest!</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: I don&rsquo;t watch too much TV but it&rsquo;d have to go to <em>Breaking Bad</em> for drama and <em><span word="Portlandia" data-scaytid="132">Portlandia</span> </em>for comedy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: The Joy Formidable absolutely blew away any other band I&rsquo;ve seen at Terminal 5. Their energy supply seemed to be endless. They were clearly having the time of their lives. Most importantly, they rocked harder and better than any other band this year, even when the drummer was dressed as a lobster during the encore.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: I would normally say Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="133">Iver</span> for winning the Grammy for Best New Artist, but Arcade Fire clearly blew the indie gates open for the award show two years ago. Instead, I&rsquo;ll go with Blur. Not for the Olympics reunion, but for deciding to stay together and play more shows next year. (Dear Blur, New York City has a new arena. I think you should play it. Please?)</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2013</strong>: The new Depeche Mode album will feature work from Alan Wilder in some capacity. Whatever song he&rsquo;s on will probably be the best one on the album. The Joy Formidable will reach &ldquo;the next level,&rdquo; whatever that means, with their second LP. Blur will be Coachella&rsquo;s big surprise headliner this year. <span word="U2" data-scaytid="134">U2</span> may re-emerge if Bono and The Edge stop messing around with the Spiderman musical. Beck&rsquo;s new record will finally come out and be really solid, but nowhere near his peak. 2013 will also see the triumphant return of The National, Pearl Jam and Arcade Fire, who will release their best record yet.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>James McKenna</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: The Dirty Projector&rsquo;s album &quot;<em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>&quot; fills my need for jerky, Talking <span word="Head-sy" data-scaytid="135">Head-sy</span> music.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU"><em>Reagan </em></a>by Killer Mike blows me away every time I hear it.</div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: Danny Baker on his radio show after he learned he was fired was fantastic. Death Grips getting dropped was good too, I love rebellion in the face of big corporations.</div>
<div><strong>Villain of the Year</strong>: Chris Brown was as vile as ever. And Danny!, but I don&rsquo;t want to get into that&hellip;</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Godspeed You! Black Emperor popping up with a new album. Plus <span word="Nas" data-scaytid="136">Nas</span> being good again.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: The <span word="Mercurys" data-scaytid="137">Mercurys</span> weren&rsquo;t great. Plus I did what Public Enemy told me not to, I believed the hype, got caught up in how incredible <em>Bad Religion</em> and <em>Pyramids </em>were, then found &quot;<em>Channel Orange</em>&quot; to be a bit middling. <span word="LMFAO" data-scaytid="138">LMFAO</span> splitting up was gutting.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>The Raid</em>, it&rsquo;s the only film I&rsquo;ve seen that&rsquo;s received a round of applause mid-film. And, for those who&rsquo;ve seen it, the finishing move using a door, that took my breath away.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year</strong>: <em>The Thick of It</em> was brilliant. That inquiry episode will be studied one day as a piece of social comment. <span word="Favourite" data-scaytid="139">Favourite</span> line from <span word="TTOI" data-scaytid="140">TTOI</span>: <em>&ldquo;I will lamp you&hellip; with a lamp!&rdquo;</em></div>
<div><strong>Live performance of the Year</strong>: Rodriguez, he was effortlessly cool and sounded just as he did on &quot;<em>Cold Fact</em>&quot; despite being a wizened old man.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the Year</strong>: Paul McCartney closing the opening ceremony to the Olympics. Just kidding, I switched off when he came on. But the earlier montage of British music through the years was pretty incredible, even if it didn&rsquo;t include The Smiths.</div>
<div><strong>Music predictions for 2013</strong>: After numerous daytime talk show appearances where <span word="Psy" data-scaytid="142">Psy</span> teaches B/C grade celebrities to dance, he&rsquo;ll release a disappointing follow up which will be everyone&rsquo;s disappointment of the year in 2013. <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="141">Azealia</span> Banks&rsquo; album release will be put back again and when released will be full of early 2012 references. And it will fail to impress. Bieber develops a smack addiction. Four words: <span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="144">Kanye</span>/Kim joint album.</div>

<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Fiona Apple - &quot;<em>The Idler Wheel...</em>&quot; &nbsp;Who knew she could create art worth considering?</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: &quot;<em>Mature Themes</em>&quot; by Ariel Pink&#39;s Haunted Graffiti. &nbsp;I&#39;ll be damned if I know why this record is getting any degree of praise.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>The Master</em> by Paul Thomas Anderson</div>

<div><u>Peter Quinton</u></div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year</strong>: Cloud Nothing&rsquo;s &quot;<em>Attack On Memory</em>,&quot; which has pretty much been my album of the year since it came out back in January (not an easy feat in my book).</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year</strong>: Mount Eerie - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ZWgFv0JDE"><em>Through The Trees, pt. 2</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Hero of the Year</strong>: MC Ride</div>
<div><strong><span word="Villian" data-scaytid="154">Villian</span> of the Year</strong>: I really want to say something other than Mike Love, but God damn, he actually made me hate him more this year than I already did.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year</strong>: Despite being a huge Phil <span word="Elverum" data-scaytid="155">Elverum</span> fan, I was actually surprised at how much I ended up loving &quot;<em>Clear Moon</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Ocean Roar</em>.&quot; I never thought he&rsquo;d release two of his best works this late in his career. Also I was pretty surprised with <span word="FlyLo’s" data-scaytid="157">FlyLo&rsquo;s</span> new album. I never thought he&rsquo;d release one of my <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="156">favourite</span> night time albums this year.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year</strong>: The new Beach Boys album would be an easy choice, but was anyone really expecting that to be good? Animal Collective and Titus <span word="Andronicus" data-scaytid="159">Andronicus</span> may have admittedly not lived up to my astronomical expectations for both bands, but both still released good albums this year, so I can&rsquo;t complain. I was also pretty disappointed in this year&rsquo;s lack of No Age and <span word="Deerhunter" data-scaytid="162">Deerhunter</span> releases, but there&rsquo;s always next year for that.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year</strong>: <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, though I haven&rsquo;t really seen too many great movies this year. I felt like this was the movie that Pixar should have made this year, and it really tickled the gamer side of me. Still, movies aren&rsquo;t really my specialty anyway.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year</strong>: <em>The Eric Andre Show</em> as far as new series go, and the last season of <em>Louie </em>had some pretty great moments. Aside from that, I think I just watched <em>Pawn Stars</em> all year.</div>
<div><strong>Live Performance of the Year</strong>: Thee Oh Sees and Ty <span word="Segall" data-scaytid="163">Segall</span> at The Well in Brooklyn. Non-stop energy from two of today&rsquo;s best rock bands plus a perfectly timed rain storm equals pure live magic. <span word="Japandroids" data-scaytid="164">Japandroids</span> is also an incredible runner up for me, and The Mountain Goats performing early renditions of &quot;<em>Transcendental Youth</em>&quot; tracks with Anonymous 4 was easily one of the most unique shows I&rsquo;ve ever been to.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year</strong>: In a totally non-Amanda Palmer related <span word="Kickstarter" data-scaytid="167">Kickstarter</span> moment, watching Black Moth Super Rainbow raise over $<span word="120k" data-scaytid="169">120k</span> on <span word="Kickstarter" data-scaytid="168">Kickstarter</span> to fund their new album, &quot;<em>Cobra Juicy</em>,&quot; complete with a video of Eric <span word="Wareheim" data-scaytid="170">Wareheim</span> talking about how his dad was blazing to the new album in the basement. The record itself was pretty awesome too.</div>
<div><strong>Music Predictions of 2013</strong>: New releases from <span word="Iceage" data-scaytid="171">Iceage</span>, Pissed Jeans, The Thermals and No Age (fingers crossed) will hopefully continue this past year&rsquo;s trend of raw, raucous, and passionate indie rock, and this is only referring to the first few months. Also, Death Grips will naturally have a clean sweep at the <span word="Grammys" data-scaytid="172">Grammys</span>, and Coachella will be supplied with a holographic Morrissey so that they can finally have their Smiths reunion.</div>
