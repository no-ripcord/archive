  <div>Another year has gone by in a flash, and what a year it&#39;s been. My Bloody Valentine finally released a new album, Bowie dropped <strong>The Next Day</strong> with no warning, Daft Punk ruled the airwaves, Robin <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Thicke" data-scaytid="1">Thicke</span> had the most controversial song in years, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Lorde" data-scaytid="13">Lorde</span>&nbsp;came out of nowhere to be 2013&#39;s biggest breakout star, Arcade Fire took promotion to another level, and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Beyoncé" data-scaytid="15">Beyoncé</span> tried to eclipse them all right at the death. And that&#39;s without even mentioning <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="17">Kanye</span>. Oh, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="19">Kanye</span>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here&#39;s our guide to the year in handy questionnaire form. Hope it was good for you as it was for us.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Juan <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="21">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez, Managing Editor</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Retroactive</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> I&rsquo;m choosing Vampire Weekend by default, simply because they delivered an incredibly smart album whilst embracing a &ldquo;keeping it real&rdquo; disposition across all media outlets. Just listen to Ezra Koenig&rsquo;s dull-witted interview with Zane Lowe, or his &ldquo;autobiographical&rdquo; <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Talkhouse" data-scaytid="25">Talkhouse</span> review of Drake&rsquo;s <strong>Nothing Was the Same</strong>. Those Oxford-wearing schmucks are smarter than you, but they don&rsquo;t shove it in your face, either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Though objectively not my favorite of the year, I found myself bewildered with These New Puritans&rsquo; wonderfully sinister <strong>Field of Reeds</strong>. In a year that almost made me reconsider the importance of an album experience, this one rekindled my love of it. It&rsquo;s certainly a mood crusher, though; stay away from it if you&rsquo;re feeling too contemplative.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Call me a yokel, but in a year swept with bouncy electro-pop and boisterous noise, I couldn&rsquo;t resist an old-fashioned folk ballad like <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Mazzy" data-scaytid="29">Mazzy</span> Star&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCccFkn_oo8"><em>Seasons of your Day</em></a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> I&rsquo;ve just about fallen in love with Sky Ferreira. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that she references Twin Peaks, or that she&rsquo;s discovered the formula to make a Tiffany song sound broodingly atmospheric, but she&rsquo;s warmed her way into my heart with an album that I couldn&#39;t stop listening to. She&rsquo;s dating the dude from <span class="scayt-misspell" word="DIIV" data-scaytid="31">DIIV</span>, but you can&rsquo;t win &lsquo;em all, I suppose.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> As much as I love Bill Callahan, I felt like he <span class="scayt-misspell" word="kinda" data-scaytid="33">kinda</span> half-assed <strong>Dream River</strong>. But this is the one that really hurt, since it&rsquo;s personal: my hard drive decided to fail on me for good this year, which led to me losing valuable interviews I had conducted with both Torres and Julia <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Holter" data-scaytid="35">Holter</span>. Let&rsquo;s just say I was devastated after the fact, and I do apologize for not featuring them on the site like I intended to this year.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> I was never a fan of <span class="scayt-misspell" word="darkwave" data-scaytid="37">darkwave</span>, maybe because I never really embraced the critical favorites. Bauhaus and Joy Division never did it for me. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve been exploring complete <span class="scayt-misspell" word="discographies" data-scaytid="39">discographies</span> by Coil, Throbbing Gristle, and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="SPK" data-scaytid="41">SPK</span>, embracing their cold, icy (not to mention danceable) <span class="scayt-misspell" word="synths" data-scaytid="43">synths</span> with gusto. All of which led me to discover <strong>You Today</strong> by contemporary composer Martial <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Canterel" data-scaytid="45">Canterel</span>, who manages to rewrite the genre in very inventive ways without falling into pastiche.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Though seeing My Bloody Valentine was a religious experience (and conflictive, since I got into a petty argument while they played in a music festival), I&rsquo;ll always remember it with a mix of awe and regret. But I&rsquo;ve got to give it to Bradford Cox for making his dramatic exit on the Jimmy Fallon show, a reminder that rock stars were meant to shake up the tedious normalcy of network television.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year:</strong> It was a pleasure to witness Jesse and Celine&rsquo;s hyper-realistic romance come to a fitting conclusion in <strong>Before Midnight</strong>. I mean, the fact that Richard <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Linklater" data-scaytid="47">Linklater</span> managed to evolve what started as a Gen X romance into a memorable trilogy leaves me at a loss of words.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year:</strong> <strong>Mad Men</strong> has done it again. Speak all you want of <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, but the impeccable writing puts every other TV drama to shame. Moment of the year: the last ten minutes of <strong>Eastbound and Down</strong>; I haven&rsquo;t laughed this much in ages.</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to wake up to a Chuck <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Klosterman" data-scaytid="49">Klosterman</span> piece over at <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Grantland" data-scaytid="51">Grantland</span>, though his contributions have decreased in the past year.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> It&rsquo;s been interesting to see <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Spotify" data-scaytid="55">Spotify</span> become the enemy of the music industry, even if many of the artists that condone its business practices continue to feature their music on the streaming service. Tiny payments for musicians will be the norm, while corporate figureheads continue to justify why a major label is still the best means to distribute and promote an album. And to that point, advertising agencies are the future - expect an influx of more major artists getting their music featured in all sorts of ads, and that is just the beginning.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="53">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> I&rsquo;ll buy any of those buggers a pint except for <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Zayn" data-scaytid="57">Zayn</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Malik" data-scaytid="59">Malik</span>, because I find it kind of insulting that he grows more facial hair than I do.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Joe Rivers (Features Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Comebacks, collaborations and controversies.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Like many others, I&rsquo;m just hugely impressed by everything about <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Lorde" data-scaytid="61">Lorde</span>.</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Charli" data-scaytid="63">Charli</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="XCX" data-scaytid="65">XCX</span> &ndash; <strong>True Romance</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Daft Punk &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpsBeaVrkE"><em>Giorgio By <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Moroder" data-scaytid="67">Moroder</span></em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> There were so many unexpected comebacks that it&rsquo;s difficult to pick just one. That said, NEW <span class="scayt-misspell" word="BEYONCÉ" data-scaytid="69">BEYONCÉ</span> ALBUM!</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year:</strong> A couple of phenomenal tracks aside, <strong>Random Access Memories</strong> was such a chore.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> I&rsquo;m pretty sure my most played album of the last twelve months is <strong>Someone To Drive You Home</strong> by The Long Blondes.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> <em>&ldquo;My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.&rdquo;</em></div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Gravity</strong>, just for the sheer cinematic experience.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year:</strong> It&rsquo;s funny, because the way this question is phrased might lead you to believe that there&rsquo;s a valid answer other than <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, which there isn&rsquo;t.</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Dorian <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Lynskey" data-scaytid="73">Lynskey</span> manages to be both informative and entertaining in a way few other music writers manage. His own wrangling over whether <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="71">Kanye</span> West is a force for good or bad this year has been extremely thought-provoking and intriguing.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> It&rsquo;s so inevitable that Sam Smith will be huge next year that it&rsquo;s actually a bit depressing. That aside, indie to become more dance-like, R&amp;B to become more indie-like, and in its last throes, chart-focused <span class="scayt-misspell" word="EDM" data-scaytid="137">EDM</span> attempts to replicate <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Avicii’s" data-scaytid="75">Avicii&rsquo;s</span> success by putting a banjo and/or accordion on everything. Finally, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="AlunaGeorge’s" data-scaytid="77">AlunaGeorge&rsquo;s</span> album may not have hit the heights I&rsquo;d hoped, but I&rsquo;ve high hopes for that futuristic R&amp;B next year, with <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kelela" data-scaytid="79">Kelela</span>, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="FKA" data-scaytid="89">FKA</span> Twigs et al.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="81">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Zayn" data-scaytid="83">Zayn</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Malik" data-scaytid="87">Malik</span>. As a former Smash Hits! reader, I like pop couples, and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Zayn" data-scaytid="85">Zayn</span> is engaged to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Perrie" data-scaytid="91">Perrie</span> from Little Mix. They&rsquo;re the Billie Piper and Richie from <span class="scayt-misspell" word="5ive" data-scaytid="93">5ive</span> of our age.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Sean Caldwell (Music Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> I never want to hear the word <span class="scayt-misspell" word="“twerk”" data-scaytid="95">&ldquo;twerk&rdquo;</span> again.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Pharrell" data-scaytid="97">Pharrell</span> Williams &mdash; Between Robin <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Thicke’s" data-scaytid="99">Thicke&rsquo;s</span> <em>Blurred Lines</em> and Daft Punk&rsquo;s <em>Get Lucky</em>, Williams became the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="12th" data-scaytid="101">12th</span> artist in music history to simultaneously be both number one and two spots in the Billboard Hot 100.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Queens of the Stone Age &mdash; <strong>&hellip;Like Clockwork</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Daft Punk &mdash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I"><em>Get Lucky</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Run The Jewels</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> Shining &mdash; <strong>One One One</strong></div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Blue <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Öyster" data-scaytid="103">Öyster</span> Cult &mdash; <strong>Tyranny &amp; Mutation</strong></div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> The death of Lou Reed.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: The Great Gatsby</strong> (as in best dressed <span class="scayt-misspell" word="turd" data-scaytid="105">turd</span> of 2013)&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: Homeland</strong></div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Marc Spitz (newest book I read in 2013 was his memoir, <strong>Poseur</strong>)</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> I will hear the word <span class="scayt-misspell" word="“twerk”" data-scaytid="107">&ldquo;twerk&rdquo;</span> again.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="109">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Robbie Williams</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Mark Davison (Film &amp; TV Editor)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Surprisingly great for British music (and, oddly, this is the one year I don&rsquo;t recall seeing a single article on the subject).</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Boards of Canada&#39;s marketing team</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year: </strong>John Grant &shy;- <strong>Pale Green Ghosts</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Lorde" data-scaytid="111">Lorde</span> &shy;- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Ymd-OCucs"><em>Tennis Court</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> New Bowie album! Even if I didn&#39;t like it that much.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> That Factory Floor album really should have been better than it was (I <span class="scayt-misspell" word="realise" data-scaytid="113">realise</span> I&rsquo;m in the minority with that one though), but&hellip;</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> &hellip;reviewing it did give me a good excuse to spend much of my summer revisiting industrial and post-industrial classics. Particularly Coil&rsquo;s <strong>Musick to Play in the Dark</strong> (both volumes).</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Even if most of The Knife&rsquo;s live show was a bit of a mixed bag of faffing about, the <strong>Silent Shout</strong> climax really was quite something.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Frances Ha</strong></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year:</strong> Toss up between <strong>Utopia </strong>and <strong>The Returned</strong> (I&rsquo;m not sure that either will stand up to being dragged out for a second season though).</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Hanna Rosin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/09/advertisement-for-murder/309435/">Craigslist Killers article</a> might be the single best thing I&rsquo;ve read this year.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> Miley Cyrus and Sinéad O&rsquo;Connor duet at the VMAs. Death Grips release a Christmas album. Everybody goes back to forgetting about Robin <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Thicke’s" data-scaytid="115">Thicke&rsquo;s</span> existence (I may be confusing &ldquo;predictions&rdquo; with &ldquo;heartfelt wishes&rdquo; here).</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="117">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Larry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Forrest Cardamenis (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> The best year for music since 2010.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> The Knife</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year: Reflektor</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6OuvGgAoJQ"><em>Blood on the Leaves</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Either the fact that we got a good Bowie album this year or the fact that we got a good My Bloody Valentine album this year. I can&rsquo;t pick one.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> I was disappointed by the way the critical community failed to really delve into major efforts, to be honest. A lot of extremely ambitious concept albums came out this year and the rush to be first and get hits overwhelmed the need for great music criticism that treats the album as a form of genuine art.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Lisa Germano &ndash; <strong>Geek The Girl</strong></div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Waiting for midnight so I, along with however many other people, could finally listen to the new My Bloody Valentine album, only for the site to crash so we had to wait longer&hellip; before finally getting to take in what is really a great album.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Upstream Color</strong>, although if we can include festival films yet to receive releases, Jafar Panahi&rsquo;s <strong>Closed Curtain</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year:</strong> Could it be anything other than <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>?</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Ummm&hellip;I suppose it&rsquo;s bad that I can&rsquo;t think of one. I&rsquo;ll say that the two reviewers I have most consistently enjoyed are No Ripcord&rsquo;s own Stephen <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wragg" data-scaytid="119">Wragg</span> and Pitchfork&rsquo;s Lindsay Zoladz.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know what it will be, but there will be some shake-ups in digital distribution and streaming sites. Hold on to your <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Spotify" data-scaytid="121">Spotify</span> accounts!</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="123">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> I honestly can&rsquo;t name a single one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Andrew Ciraulo (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> The cool kids have ﬁnally stumbled upon the polyphonic synthesizer (retro ones, of course).&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Daft Punk</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Boards of Canada - <strong>Tomorrowʼs Harvest</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Daft Punk - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljQdZEMs31g"><em>Touch</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Boards of Canada made a new album! AHHHHHHH!!!!</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> Ghost BCʼs new album. Thatʼs what us industry people call a sophomore slump, folks.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Miles Davis - <strong>In A Silent Way</strong></div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Titus Andronicus playing their last set at the now defunct Maxwellʼs in Hoboken, NJ; further proof that good things can never last.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Paciﬁc Rim</strong> (Iʼm dead serious, it was awesome!)</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: Breaking Bad</strong> (duh)</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> All of my favorite writers are either dead or currently inactive, so Iʼm going to abstain from this one. I hear George RR Martin is making some good money though...</div>
<div><strong>Musical Predictions for 2014:</strong> An intense space-race will erupt between Lady Gaga and The Flaming Lips (feat. Ke$ha, no less) over who will be the ﬁrst artist to perform on the moon. The Flaming Lips will lose, of course, but will still play a follow-up set after Gaga. Coincidentally, an otherworldly ship carrying the clandestine survivors of an extra-terrestrial race and the cure for every ailment known to mankind will pass by the elaborate musical display. Although they are plenty amused by the humansʼ elaborate use of neon lighting and plastic tubing, the occupants of the shuttle will ultimately decide to pass Earth by and chart a course directly for the Sun. In other news, former American presidential candidate Mitt Romney will form a hip-hop collective with Sisqó, Dave Matthews, and the reanimated corpse of Roger Ebert. Too soon? Deﬁnitely too soon...</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Peter Quinton (Staff Writer)</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Uh-huh, honey!</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Three-way tie. Deafheaven for coming out of nowhere with one of the year&rsquo;s best albums (and proving to be an incredible live force), My Bloody Valentine for proving that their music is just as vital today as it was more than twenty years ago, and Oneohtrix Point Never for cementing himself as one of the greatest artists around today</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> My Bloody Valentine &ndash; <strong>m b v</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Deafheaven &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyVhIBmdGw"><em>Dream House</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Surprises becoming increasingly less surprising</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> No Age &ndash; <strong>An Object</strong>. It was a good album with a few highlights, but it was seriously missing the power and momentum that trademarked their previous releases. The fact that it&rsquo;s been three years since they released anything beforehand also didn&rsquo;t help.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Regarding releases right before 2013, Waxahatchee &ndash; <strong>American Weekend</strong> and Tyvek &ndash; <strong>On Triple Beams</strong> were serious highlights I more or less missed last year, and <strong>good kid, m.A.A.d city</strong> eventually clicked with me. 2013 Should also be considered the year I officially came to good terms with emo.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> The weekend My Bloody Valentine released their new album, followed by obsessing over how great the finished product was throughout the year. It made the particularly cold and snowy winter here in New Jersey all the more beautiful.</div>

<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> I can barely trace any widespread movements from 2013, and most of the greatest musical achievements seem to be markedly singular.<br /><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="127">Kanye</span> West. During his infamous interview with Zane Lowe this year, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="129">Kanye</span> said something that I think illuminates why I got so into what he&rsquo;s been creating: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="131">Kanye</span> West fan, you&rsquo;re not a fan of me, you&rsquo;re a fan of yourself. You will believe in yourself. I&rsquo;m just the espresso. I&rsquo;m just a shot in the morning to get you going, to make you believe you can overcome the situation that you&rsquo;re dealing with all the time.&rdquo; And then there&rsquo;s that snapshot non-sequitur on <strong>Yeezus</strong>&rsquo; opening track, <em>On Sight</em>, from a song the studio went to great lengths to recreate when they couldn&rsquo;t get sampling rights:<em> &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll give us what we need / It may not be what we want&rdquo;</em>. It sums up my conflicted feelings towards the content of <strong>Yeezus</strong>. I do feel like I needed this record this year.<br /><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Oneohtrix Point Never &ndash; <strong>R Plus Seven</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t expect this to be my <span class="scayt-misspell" word="favourite" data-scaytid="364">favourite</span>, because its appeal was more academic than emotive. Or rather, I found it beautiful and engaging, but in a way that I only understood when I gave the record more scrutiny. It sounds very new, but I don&rsquo;t expect it to be influential; this record is the culmination of a lot of fascinating trends in underground music (particularly the hazy &ldquo;vaporwave&rdquo; movement), what Oneohtrix himself described as a &ldquo;dialectical wheel&rdquo; between the serious avant-garde and disposable background music.<br /><strong>Track of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kanye" data-scaytid="133">Kanye</span> West &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLx11xq6X7Q"><em>Black Skinhead</em></a>. I walk about twice as fast as usual when I&rsquo;m listening to <em>Black Skinhead</em>. I should probably take my headphones off when I&rsquo;m walking through the city at night, but it&rsquo;s easier to just blast this song and feel invincible.<br /><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Laura Marling&rsquo;s new record absolutely bowled me over. I am amazed by how much she moves on as an artist, on every record.<br /><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> A tie between Baths&rsquo; <strong>Obsidian</strong> and Dismemberment Plan&rsquo;s <strong>Uncanney Valley</strong>. Two offensively bad records from groups who&rsquo;ve done much better.<br /><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Smog &ndash; <strong>Knock Knock</strong>. These songs made me feel grown up. In a year where I&rsquo;ve kept trying to grow up several times, Smog soundtracked a lot of my walking and thinking time. Songs like <em>River Guard</em> and <em>I Could Drive Forever</em> said so much to me about my place in the world. Sometimes Bill Callahan said things that might seem immature, like<em> &ldquo;How can I stand / And laugh with the man / Who redefined your body?&rdquo;</em> and made them sound wise. There seemed to be a lot of universal truths on this record.<br /><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> The ending of <strong>You Are The Apple</strong> by Lady Lamb the Beekeeper &ndash; jaw-dropping.<br /><strong>Film of the year:</strong> I never see enough films, but <strong>Upstream Colour</strong> is the one which will stay with me the longest.<br /><strong>TV show of the year:</strong> It has to be <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>.<br /><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Although he hasn&rsquo;t had a very prolific year, I wanted to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="reblog" data-scaytid="370">reblog</span> almost every one of <a href="http://www.markrichardson.org/">Mark Richardson&rsquo;s <span class="scayt-misspell" word="tumblr" data-scaytid="366">tumblr</span> posts</a> this year. He has both my respect and my envy &ndash; his life seems so wonderfully connected to the music he listens to (check out his <span class="scayt-misspell" word="sideproject" data-scaytid="372">sideproject</span> <a href="https://invisiblemusic.tumblr.com/">Invisible Music</a>, where he posts tracks with no ID tags along with a personal experience to which he relates them). It makes sense that I connected with Richardson&rsquo;s writing the same year I got into Smog. Richardson is a huge admirer of his, and the same wise attention to detail is what made me want to learn so much from them.<br /><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> I think two years ago I said <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Azealia" data-scaytid="368">Azealia</span> Banks&rsquo; album would come out and it&rsquo;d be huge, so I&rsquo;ll refrain from making serious predictions, and instead pick an improbable-but-not-impossible band reunion: I choose Sleater-Kinney!<br /><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="135">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Man, One Direction has not even entered into my cultural sphere in any meaningful way, which I suppose is something most people would envy.<span bookmark="1">&nbsp;</span></div>

<div><strong>Film of the year:</strong> This was the year I changed demographics. I turned 24 and, like the advertisers predicted, I dropped off the map.

<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> I&#39;ve become obsessed with Mallory <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Ortberg" data-scaytid="277">Ortberg</span>, a blogger for The Toast. Her &quot;Texts&nbsp;<span>From...&quot; series is some of the funniest writing I&#39;ve had the pleasure of reading in years.</span></div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> I&#39;m really hoping we get another push for originality. It&#39;s really tough coming up with fresh ideas these days, and there&#39;s too much of a temptation to reinvent the wheel instead of spinning it in an interesting new direction. How about some more soul/funk revival? Let&#39;s go with that.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="279">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> David Bowie.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Richard Petty</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Trap went mainstream; goodbye, trap.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="OAP" data-scaytid="281">OAP</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="MPV" data-scaytid="283">MPV</span> Danny Brown</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year: Overgrown</strong> by James Blake</div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxgqpCdOKak"><em>Hold On, We&rsquo;re Going Home</em></a> by Drake</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="MBV" data-scaytid="285">MBV</span> finally releasing an album</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> The-Dream&rsquo;s <strong>IV Play</strong>, definitely not a radio <span class="scayt-misspell" word="killa" data-scaytid="287">killa</span>.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year: Complex Simplicity</strong> by <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Teedra" data-scaytid="289">Teedra</span> Moses</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> R Kelly singing about being a sex dolphin.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year:</strong> I ain&rsquo;t been cinema enough to say, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="bruv" data-scaytid="291">bruv</span>.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: Breaking Bad</strong></div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Morrissey, for the first half of his autobiography before he started moaning.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> The nuptials of Mr Gucci Mane and Miss Miley Cyrus</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="293">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> The first to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="realise" data-scaytid="295">realise</span> the monster they&rsquo;ve become, then leave and reveal the band&#39;s fetid secrets, like how Harry Styles huffs glue out of a <span class="scayt-misspell" word="YSL" data-scaytid="297">YSL</span> sock.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Carl <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Purvis" data-scaytid="299">Purvis</span></u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> Top heavy.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the Year:</strong> Queens of the Stone Age. Produced an incredible record after a dark period for the band, incorporated such an accomplished range of extended family members into their writing and played some quite simply scintillating shows towards the end of the year.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year:</strong> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="QOTSA" data-scaytid="301">QOTSA</span> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9OfBcjyxKY"><em>I Appear Missing</em></a>. A haunting lullaby that evolves into a tormenting vortex, and it will have you looking over your shoulder, checking your wardrobes at night, and fighting a tidal wave of foreboding. Josh used his near death experience to add astonishing texture to this one.</div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year:</strong> Kurt Vile - <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wakin" data-scaytid="303">Wakin</span> on a Pretty Daze</strong>. Just an amazing listen.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year:</strong> Bowie bringing out an LP, and it being sensational.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year:</strong> One of the best bands on the planet, Arcade Fire, bringing out a double album which fell below expectations. Double albums can make or break a band, and they break more than they make.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Yuck - <strong>Yuck</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Moment of the Year:</strong> Arctic Monkeys&rsquo; Glastonbury headline set. <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Revelled" data-scaytid="305">Revelled</span> in the limelight and smashed it after their <span class="scayt-misspell" word="underwhelming" data-scaytid="307">underwhelming</span> previous attempt.</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year: Rush.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the Year: WWE Late Night Raw.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Writer of the Year:</strong> Dan Carson (Line of Best Fit)</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> The Smiths will headline Glastonbury.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="309">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Miley Cyrus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Craig Stevens</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence: </strong>Sophisticated, adventurous and interesting - particularly pop and hip-hop.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Arcade Fire (especially for their approach to the <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Reflektor" data-scaytid="311">Reflektor</span> </strong>campaign and to their live gigs)</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Arctic Monkeys - <strong>AM</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Daft Punk - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I"><em>Get Lucky</em></a></div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> Daft Punk announcing a new album and subsequently releasing <strong>Random Access Memories</strong> within a matter of months</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> King <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Krule" data-scaytid="313">Krule</span></div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Depeche Mode - <strong>Violator</strong></div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Seeing Chic at <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Bestival" data-scaytid="315">Bestival</span></div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Rush</strong></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: Breaking Bad</strong></div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> J.K. Rowling</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> THUMPERS and Laura Welsh will find chart success, and Banks and Cyril Hahn will release albums to high critical acclaim. <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Azealia" data-scaytid="319">Azealia</span> Banks will delay releasing her debut album again. By the time it is finally released, everyone will have moved on.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="317">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Liam Payne (I admit, I had to Google the band members&#39; names. I also admit that I picked Liam at random).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Dominic Stevenson</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> The year women took over as the powerhouses of song writing, and Bowie returned!</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the Year:</strong> Julia <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Holter" data-scaytid="321">Holter</span>. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy choice, with Bowie, Morrissey speaking out more than ever and his <span class="scayt-misspell" word="biog" data-scaytid="325">biog</span> bringing attention to his back <span class="scayt-misspell" word="catalogue" data-scaytid="323">catalogue</span>, and many others, but the album of the year led me to pick this lady.</div>
<div><strong>Album of the Year:</strong> Julia <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Holter" data-scaytid="327">Holter</span> - <strong>Loud City Song</strong>. It&rsquo;s a remarkable and unique journey from start to finish that goes a long way to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="symbolising" data-scaytid="329">symbolising</span> how high the standard of the year&rsquo;s music has been.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the Year:</strong> Man Man - <em>On <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Oni" data-scaytid="331">Oni</span> Pond</em>. A modern pop classic. I still can&rsquo;t stop playing it months later. A remarkable song.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the Year:</strong> David Bowie&rsquo;s return. What a way to start the year and what a way to silence those who had spoken out and predicted his retirement due to the length of his absence. His album, <strong>The Next Day</strong>, had taken two years to record and hadn&rsquo;t been leaked to a soul. In the age of technology THAT is one heck of a feat.</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the Year:</strong> Still no album by The Wrens or The Avalanches. Nothing from these two acts = sorrow.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year:</strong> Nirvana - <strong>In Utero</strong>. Time and again this album <span class="scayt-misspell" word="reignites" data-scaytid="333">reignites</span> all faith in loud music and reminds us of what a tragic loss it was when Kurt <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Cobain’s" data-scaytid="335">Cobain&rsquo;s</span> body departed this earth. A classic and by far my <span class="scayt-misspell" word="favourite" data-scaytid="337">favourite</span> Nirvana record.</div>
<div><strong>Musical Moment of the Year:</strong> The teased and eventual return of Arcade Fire. What a campaign, what a band, what an album, what a world they created. Magical stuff all the way!</div>
<div><strong>Film of the Year: Before Midnight</strong>. In the cinema it was one of the only films I saw, and I had waited it for several years. It ended somewhat brutally, but it was real. Incredibly real, in fact. At home, <strong>The Hobbit</strong>, part one.</div>
<div><strong>TV Show of the Year: Parks and Recreation</strong>. A mind-blowing TV comedy. All the main characters are exceptional, the actors fit the characters remarkably well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the Year:</strong> Morrissey. Who else could it have been? What a mind: scathing, beautiful, lonely and completely unique. A tragic and golden story told, by a master.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> The year will prove that 2013 wasn&rsquo;t a fluke with some more incredible releases across the board.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="339">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know anything about that act (thankfully).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>Carlos Villarreal</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> 2013 was a great year for <span class="scayt-misspell" word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="341">lo-fi</span>; sort of.</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Kurt Vile for making another great album!</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> Kurt Vile - <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wakin" data-scaytid="343">Wakin</span> on a Pretty Daze</strong></div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Kurt Vile&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd0K76H7sU8"><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wakin" data-scaytid="345"><em>Wakin</em></span><em> on a Pretty Daze</em></a>, it&rsquo;s just so lovely!</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> I finally graduated from college!</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> Not finishing my collection of short stories for short people.</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year: </strong>Wild Beasts - <strong>Two Dancers</strong>. It&rsquo;s simply haunting.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> Justin Bieber announcing he was retiring from music. There&rsquo;s still hope in the world!</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Frances Ha</strong>. &nbsp;A frank and funny tale of youth and suburban life; think of Jim <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Jarmusch" data-scaytid="346">Jarmusch</span> meet <strong>Girls</strong>.</div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: American Horror Story</strong>. A woman being burned at the stake, a witch being <span class="scayt-misspell" word="roofied" data-scaytid="348">roofied</span>, a demonic creature being beheaded, and that&rsquo;s only the first episode of the new season&hellip;</div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Stephen J. <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Dubner" data-scaytid="350">Dubner</span>. An author, journalist and co-host of the <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Freakonomics" data-scaytid="352">Freakonomics</span> </strong>podcast, a man of many talents. His writing has been a great inspiration to me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> The rebirth of disco-punk, well sort of.</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="354">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> The one with the hair.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>David Wood</u></div>
<div><strong>Sum up music in 2013 in one sentence:</strong> The year of the comeback (for better or for worse)</div>
<div><strong>Artist of the year:</strong> Kevin Shields</div>
<div><strong>Album of the year:</strong> My Bloody Valentine &ndash; <strong>mbv</strong>. So far ahead of the rest it&rsquo;s almost laughable.</div>
<div><strong>Track of the year:</strong> Arcade Fire &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcKinnMXuKg"><em>Afterlife</em></a>. The key track from a flawed yet fascinating album.</div>
<div><strong>Surprise of the year:</strong> That Bowie&rsquo;s comeback album is actually pretty good</div>
<div><strong>Disappointment of the year:</strong> That <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="mbv" data-scaytid="356">mbv</span> </strong>was not even considered for the Mercury Music Prize due to some arcane ruling about it having to be released on a physical format. Come on guys, how do think most people purchase and listen to music these days?</div>
<div><strong>Album released before 2013 that you discovered (or rediscovered) this year: <span class="scayt-misspell" word="mbv" data-scaytid="358">mbv</span></strong> made me wonder if <strong>Loveless </strong>was really as good as we all remember. The answer? Yes, it was&hellip; Fuck yes.</div>
<div><strong>Musical moment of the year:</strong> The death of Lou Reed. And the sorry sight of a BBC News obit piece: a brief bit of VU, <em>Walk On The Wild Side</em>, then silence until the <em>Perfect Day</em> cover. Really? No Ripcord&rsquo;s retrospective provides some welcome balance.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Film of the year: Gravity</strong></div>
<div><strong>TV show of the year: Peaky Blinders</strong></div>
<div><strong>Writer of the year:</strong> Donna <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Tartt" data-scaytid="360">Tartt</span> &ndash; another stellar comeback, this time of a literary kind.</div>
<div><strong>Musical predictions for 2014:</strong> Further retrenchment by the majors, further fragmentation of the mainstream, more artists exist at the margins, meaning the margins are pushed ever outwards.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Favourite" data-scaytid="362">Favourite</span> member of One Direction:</strong> Who?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That was us - how about you? We&#39;d love to hear from you in that handy rectangular comment box below. Happy New Year and here&#39;s to a great 2014!</div>
