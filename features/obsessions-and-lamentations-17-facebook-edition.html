  <p>I don&rsquo;t like Facebook, even though I&rsquo;m on it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get to that contradiction in a minute.&nbsp; First let me say that I don&rsquo;t expect this screed to be part of the first wave of a Facebook backlash lurking on the horizon.&nbsp; Technology that has become ubiquitous is never subject to a backlash, or at least not one that it doesn&rsquo;t just steamroll over.&nbsp; TV may have had a backlash, but you&rsquo;ll spend hours in the Cleveland Plain Dealer archives trying to document it.&nbsp; Still, if you went back and dug up all those predictions that TV would take over our lives and rot American brains, well, have you seen our 5th grade Math &amp; Science ranking lately?&nbsp; And the sad fact is we may have internalized the criticism, have come to accept it as given, yet still watch 151 hours of the stupor-inducing swill per month, an all-time high according to the Nielsen Company.&nbsp; We are vanquished colonists, in TV&rsquo;s thrall and grumbling all the while.&nbsp; And so it will be with Facebook.&nbsp; With about 25% of the world&rsquo;s internet users already sporting a page full of useless aphorisms and little league baseball pics, it&rsquo;s fair to say we are already conquered.</p>
<p>How did it happen?&nbsp; Anthropologists say we are social creatures, so at first blush this phenomenon seems like the natural next step towards forming a global connection, or Gaia, if you went to graduate school.&nbsp; But think about your own social relations.&nbsp; They tend to break down into 4 major groups.&nbsp; First are people you don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Second are people you casually know, maybe knew better at some point in the past or run into now and again.&nbsp; These people used to be called acquaintances, but now are called &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some people I barely know have 1,216 &ldquo;friends&rdquo;, and I am among them.&nbsp; Then there are what used to be called friends, who are now a small subset of &ldquo;friends&rdquo;.&nbsp; These are people you actually like.&nbsp; Finally there are your loved ones, who are more than your friends but are also just your &ldquo;friends&rdquo;, like everyone else.&nbsp; These are the only people we want around us all the time and they can usually be counted on one hand.&nbsp; Everybody else we prefer to deal with on our own terms.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is where Facebook comes in.</p>
<p>But while brooding on all of this, I am reminded of the OJ Simpson trial, which for those of you not living in the States in the mid 90s, was the biggest thing to hit here since the Beatles.&nbsp; I, like most people, thought it ridiculous when Simpson was first accused of brutally killing his wife and her friend.&nbsp; OJ was a good guy; kind, gentle, affable, game for a good laugh (see Naked Gun).&nbsp; But I remember thinking during the high speed chase we all watched on live television, &ldquo;Jesus, he really did this!&nbsp; I guess we didn&rsquo;t really know him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve kept that lesson handy every time I watch the star of the moment, say, Sarah Palin, ruthlessly manage their public image.&nbsp; Palin is not a crazed murderer, as far as I know (and I take her word for it that she has never decapitated someone in a fit of rage), but she maintains a tight veil of secrecy around her (see recent Vanity Fair article) and still manages to pull strings throughout the lower 48.&nbsp; How does she do it?&nbsp; Facebook.</p>
<p>The sad fact is we have a little OJ and Palin, killers respectively of ex-wives and wolves, in all of us.&nbsp; We all want the perks and pleasures of popularity and universal love without the messy downside.&nbsp; They say that most people&rsquo;s greatest fear is public speaking.&nbsp; Facebook solves this problem by providing everyone with a stage on which to strut without the risk of tripping on the footlights.&nbsp; We can all be our own PR experts advising ourselves, the stars of our own show, exactly what post or link will enhance our public image.&nbsp; And so we can all fulfill our lifelong dreams to become who we are not, virtually speaking.&nbsp; After he tried to hack off Ron Goldman&rsquo;s head, OJ tried desperately to don his happy-go-lucky mask, which helped him escape prosecution (hundreds of years of racial persecution didn&rsquo;t hurt either).&nbsp; Can you imagine if he had Facebook?&nbsp; Jeez, anybody that posts the double-rainbow dude youtube video can&rsquo;t be half bad, eh?&nbsp; Look what it&rsquo;s doing for Palin, by all accounts a ruthlessly vindictive halfwit whose cocksure, self-aggrandizing demeanor would be hard enough to take organizing who brings what snack to the kid&rsquo;s weekly soccer games, much less threatening to be leader of the free world.&nbsp; Online, she morphs into her unique combination of Mama Grizzly and William Kristol&rsquo;s right nut, avoiding what we all fear most &ndash; exposure.&nbsp; And again I return to our continuing fascination with vampires; this time to note that they too wilt in the light of day.&nbsp; No wonder we love them.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg may be an accidental billionaire, but it is no accidental irony that such a social misfit created the largest social networking platform in world history.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s perhaps the most effective mechanism yet found by which to slip out of our own uncomfortable skins.&nbsp; So like it or not, it&rsquo;s here to stay.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve only begun to see what monsters it will spew forth.&nbsp; Like a lot of people, I&rsquo;m planning to see &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo; this opening weekend because I like David Fincher and hearing a choir singing Radiohead gets my blood pumping.&nbsp; But even more interesting perhaps is a new documentary called &ldquo;Catfish&rdquo;, which tells the story of a young man&rsquo;s Facebook relationship with a woman who, spoiler alert, is not all she&rsquo;s cracked up to be.&nbsp; What do you do when you fall in love with someone who doesn&rsquo;t actually exist?&nbsp; My bet is, a lot of people are about to find out.</p>
