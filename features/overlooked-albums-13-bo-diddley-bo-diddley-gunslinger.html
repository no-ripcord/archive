  <p>Talk about DIY. Bo <span word="Diddley" data-scaytid="3">Diddley</span> did it long before it was fashionable. The songs on&nbsp;<strong>Bo <span word="Diddley" data-scaytid="4">Diddley</span> Is A Gunslinger</strong> are home recordings; basement tapes years before&nbsp;Dylan and The Stones made their own. Even the photo session for the album cover was paid out of Diddley&rsquo;s own pocket, a princely sum of fifty dollars. The&nbsp;bosses at Chess Records were tight with other people&rsquo;s money, and many&nbsp;amongst their great roster of artists never saw half of the royalties they earned.&nbsp;Given this, cutting the overhead and avoiding studio surcharges were sound&nbsp;financial moves for <span word="Diddley" data-scaytid="8">Diddley</span>.</p>
<p>Diddley was born Ellas Otha Bates in McComb, Mississippi, not far from the&nbsp;Louisiana border. The McDaniel surname came later when he was adopted by&nbsp;his mother&rsquo;s cousin, who transplanted him to Chicago. As a boy, young Ellas was&nbsp;schooled in violin and trombone, but he was soon seduced by the gospel music,&nbsp;blues, and race records that were the Southside&rsquo;s lifeblood.</p>
<p>When the big beat became rock and roll, Ellas was in the forefront with a new&nbsp;name and a new sound. The Latin-tinged <em>Bo Diddley</em> would become a&nbsp;milestone, widening the musical canvas with cross-rhythms that broke away from the standard 4/4 beat. But Diddley was not a one-trick pony. <em>I&rsquo;m A Man</em> was a carnal blues that became a staple for Chicago blues players and&nbsp;British bands such as The Yardbirds. Those two songs were the A and B side&nbsp;of Diddley&rsquo;s first single, a musical big bang that had a huge impact on musicians&nbsp;and a welcoming public.</p>
<p>A constant during Diddley&rsquo;s career was his willingness to explore new&nbsp;sounds and styles. He loved to change musical hats as a crack session player&nbsp;for other Chess artists, as a guitar and amp designer, or as producer. Case&nbsp;in point is <strong>...Gunslinger</strong>, which was recorded in two different locations but&nbsp;sounds as sharp and well-modulated as any studio recording produced by&nbsp;Chess at that time. Its title song is a boastful chant that features the patterned&nbsp;Diddley hambone beat. With that out of the way, variety is the norm. There&nbsp;are fast rockers (<em>Ride On Josephine</em>, <em>Cadillac</em>), doo-wop (<em>Somewhere</em>),&nbsp;dance steps (<em>Doing The Crawdaddy</em>), novelty (<em>Whoa Mule!</em>), even a guitar&nbsp;and sax instrumental (<em>Diddling</em>). There are no fillers here; the songs show the&nbsp;unfettered confidence of someone at the top of his game. The five unreleased&nbsp;songs included in the CD version are worth the price alone, all sharing the&nbsp;verve and playfulness of the album&rsquo;s original tracks.</p>
<p>The album&rsquo;s most famous track is <em>Cadillac</em>, later covered by The Kinks on&nbsp;their first record, which illustrates the high regard in which Diddley&nbsp;was held amongst British&nbsp;musicians, many of whom honed their skills learning his guitar licks. There was&nbsp;also a great number of fans that anticipated each new release. Not&nbsp;surprisingly, <strong>...Gunslinger</strong> sold better in the UK than it did in the USA.</p>
<p>Diddley would go on to have a modest run of charting singles until 1967. His&nbsp;career as a Chess recording artist ended in 1973. He still got ahead through&nbsp;sheer determination, playing in rock and roll revival shows and small venues,&nbsp;and recording sporadically. Always ready for new experiences, he even found&nbsp;time to serve as deputy sheriff for the Valencia County Citizen&rsquo;s Patrol in New&nbsp;Mexico. What made him bitter was the fact that his recording earnings never&nbsp;matched his sales. The Chess buyout by GRT in 1969 and the subsequent&nbsp;sales of its catalog from one company to another made royalty statements&nbsp;hard to track down.</p>
<p>Diddley&rsquo;s music would be rediscovered by succeeding generations. George&nbsp;Thorogood virtually made a career reworking his songs. The Clash were in awe&nbsp;of him, requesting Diddley as the opening act for their 1979 American Tour.&nbsp;Around this time he started to garner long-overdue accolades as a pioneer, becoming&nbsp;a Rock And Roll Hall of Fame inductee in 1987. Numerous life-achievement&nbsp;awards followed. Less reported were the great number of charity events he&nbsp;supported throughout his lifetime.</p>
<p>Diddley&rsquo;s performing career ended in 2007 when he suffered a stroke after a&nbsp;gig. He died of heart failure on June 2, 2008. Listening to a gospel song on his&nbsp;death bed, his last words were &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to heaven&rdquo;. And he did.</p>
