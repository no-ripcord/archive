  <div><em>Listen, instead </em><em>to</em></div>
<div><em>Winter&#39;s promise</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Come down by the</em></div>
<div><em>banks of the river.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>And I shall teach you</em></div>
<div><em>the secret name of things.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Originally released on his own Sustain-Release Private Press as a limited edition&nbsp;Book &amp; CD package in 2009, Richard Skelton&#39;s <strong>Landings </strong>was re-released as a&nbsp;standalone CD by the ever-wonderful Type Records in early 2010. This support&nbsp;may or may not have resulted in the record&#39;s rise beyond experimental music&#39;s&nbsp;ever-wavering high watermark to the attention of the online music media,&nbsp;garnering a number of supportive mentions towards the tail end of last year. That&nbsp;said, it is also the sort of music that can easily slip off the radar, hence the need&nbsp;for this article. In preparation, I contacted Richard and asked him if he would&nbsp;mind answering a few questions, to which he kindly agreed. His responses have&nbsp;been subsequently incorporated within as well as choice quotes from the written&nbsp;element of <strong>Landings</strong>, which are reproduced here with the author&rsquo;s permission.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Something that I found especially striking as a lover of words, was that the&nbsp;original self-release comes as a lovingly fashioned Book and CD package.&nbsp;Turning the pages to read while the first achingly drawn notes of the sweepingly&nbsp;emotive <em>Noon Hill Wood</em> cry out is an all-too rare experience. Following the rise&nbsp;and fall of the music by reading its creator&#39;s underlying thoughts and inquisitive&nbsp;exploration of the history of the land becomes an almost symbiotic undertaking.&nbsp;When an artist works within different disciplines, their works are often completed&nbsp;in one or the other: writing or music, illustration or poetry, photography or&nbsp;sculpture. Here, Lancashire native Skelton presents a compendium of thoughts,&nbsp;poem fragments and musical compositions that together form a blissful soliloquy;&nbsp;a fascinating view into one man&#39;s inner world as he processes numerous&nbsp;emotions by engaging deeply with the land around him, questioning and&nbsp;exploring, incorporating it into his being until the lines between what is his and&nbsp;what belongs to the earth dissolve like the mist that hangs over the moors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The music he created as a result of these regular immersions, much of it&nbsp;recorded in and around northern England&#39;s oft neglected West <span word="Pennines" data-scaytid="1">Pennines</span>, is&nbsp;so intrinsically linked to the words of the book that had they remained hidden&nbsp;amongst a stack of personal notebooks we would have been denied a vital&nbsp;element of this artwork. Reflecting his relationship with the land across which he walks, each informs the other. Each helps the other to understand its own place&nbsp;more clearly: &quot;During my childhood the foothills that make up the West <span word="Pennine" data-scaytid="2">Pennine</span> Moors were something of a fixture on the horizon. Distant, but ever-present,&nbsp;nevertheless. A reminder that there was something else out there. That it wasn&#39;t&nbsp;simply endless suburbs; concrete, metal and glass.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skelton&#39;s first wife Louise, to whom this record is dedicated, passed away&nbsp;in 2005, and it seems only natural that part of a complex grieving process would&nbsp;take the form of long excursions into nature. To places they had been, revisiting&nbsp;moments they had shared.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Footprints. In the soft, damp earth</em></div>
<div><em>Mine encircling hers. How quickly</em></div>
<div><em>they faded into barely recognizable</em></div>
<div><em>marks. Had we really been here at all?</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a result, <strong>Landings </strong>was written &quot;in the shadow of bereavement. It was a <span word="labour" data-scaytid="3">labour</span> of love.&quot; Clearly, this is an intensely personal work and as such there is a subtle&nbsp;voyeurism to its exploration that is unavoidably entrancing to the outsider. We&nbsp;look in on this world and we want to understand, to <span word="empathise" data-scaytid="4">empathise</span>, to wonder how&nbsp;we would cope if put in the same position. &quot;Part of the process, for me, was a feeling of complete dislocation, and a consequent desire to anchor myself. To&nbsp;root myself in the physical. In landscape.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although <strong>Landings </strong>marks the culmination of four years of recordings and&nbsp;writing, Skelton himself is no newcomer. He has been releasing music under&nbsp;a variety of <span word="neogolistic" data-scaytid="5">neogolistic</span> pseudonyms for over five years, of which <span word="Heidika" data-scaytid="6">Heidika</span>,&nbsp;<span word="Carousell" data-scaytid="7">Carousell</span>, <span word="Harlassen" data-scaytid="8">Harlassen</span> and A Broken Consort are just a few. Alongside <strong>Marking Time</strong>&nbsp;(Preservation, 2008), <strong>Landings </strong>is the only other work to be released under his&nbsp;name. As he points out: &quot;Music is essentially <span word="aetheric" data-scaytid="9">aetheric</span> and abstract. A name&nbsp;&ndash; along with the accompanying artwork, text and packaging &ndash; creates a world&nbsp;for the music to inhabit. The music comes first and then the name suggests&nbsp;itself.&quot; On this occasion however, &quot;As the music was an attempt to <span word="distill" data-scaytid="10">distill</span> a real&nbsp;landscape, and the text described my own reflections on the landscape itself, it&nbsp;seemed natural that the project would bear my own name.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In his own words, <strong>Landings </strong>is &quot;an attempt to imaginatively engage with a&nbsp;landscape, to connect with a place and its history in a way that is filled with&nbsp;gesture and ritual.&quot; And ritual, whether deliberate or naturally evolving, certainly&nbsp;contributes to the faded twilight air of <span word="surreality" data-scaytid="11">surreality</span> that surrounds this album from&nbsp;the first note to the last. The whole project could very easily have slipped into&nbsp;a rather self-absorbed mire in the hands of one less genuine, less aware. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;testament to his skills as a composer that moments of that nature never occur.&nbsp;Consequently it is a feeling of purity and honesty that permeates most deeply. As his walks became a provider of the solace he sought, Skelton recounts his desire&nbsp;to give something back to the land that is healing him:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>It&#39;s been over a year since I left an offering here. A little box. Music. Photographs.&nbsp;Sense memories. I cross the spoil heap towards the outcrop of trees. The soft&nbsp;earth underfoot. Faint memories of that first visit, with her, many years ago. I&nbsp;try to remember my reasons for secreting these things here. A mark of passing.&nbsp;Tied to the land. Something to hold against the forgetful earth. And its hideous,&nbsp;healing softness.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With much of the music recorded on location in the early hours the morning&nbsp;when all was quiet, &ldquo;the only encounters I had were with animals. Cattle&nbsp;and horses are particularly inquisitive.&rdquo; That age-old association between man&nbsp;and the land, emotions and their expression, is compounded on record by an&nbsp;honest, open orchestration and a flowing, immersive listening experience that&nbsp;has the power to transport the listener deep into the world of its creator. Midway&nbsp;through <em>Scar Tissue</em>, distant birdsong can be heard, lending a rhythmic hand as&nbsp;watery guitar lines sway uncertainly as if flustered by the wind, embarrassed by&nbsp;the wider spaces they inhabit. Rusting, bowed strings rise and fall during <em>Threads&nbsp;Across the River</em>, tugging at the heart, followed by the hazy thickness of <em>Green&nbsp;Withins Brook</em> where much emphasis is placed upon the echoing reverberations&nbsp;of tone and the layers of droning harmonics, a feature that recurs throughout the&nbsp;record.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>In some oblique fashion this music has come to work its way into the moor&nbsp;itself. Played over and over again at various times and places, it mediates my&nbsp;experience of this landscape. Conjures it. Summons it. Suffuses it.&nbsp;Bowed, plucked and chafed steel strings. The sound of stones gently rubbed&nbsp;together. Soft soil sprinkled on resonant wooden bodies. Grasses and leaves&nbsp;intertwined around neck and fretboard. Bone and wood plectra. Sound folded on&nbsp;sound. A collusion of place and instrument.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Undertow </em>glides along with washes of plaintive cello and what could be the high-pitched cries of crows, picking at a dead sheep carcass. It is suffused with a&nbsp;feeling a hope that continues throughout the remainder of the record. <em>Voice of&nbsp;the Brook</em> howls and wails its twisted lullaby, feral and alive. <em>Pariah </em>revisits <em>Scar&nbsp;Tissue</em>&#39;s pensive guitar before dissolving into the final glowing triumvirate which&nbsp;throbs with fizzing intensity: the culmination of all that has come before; a strong&nbsp;and moving testament, an imperfect statement of devotion, a pathway through&nbsp;the wreckage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>I turned and looked</em></div>
<div><em>For you becoming light</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>I turned and looked</em></div>
<div><em>For you becoming</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>And what impression</em></div>
<div><em>The shape leaves</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In dealing with loss in this way, Skelton deepens his connection to the world&nbsp;around him: &quot;What I found compelling were the traces of humanity I found there&nbsp;&ndash; the scars of centuries of human habitation. My own questions about transience&nbsp;and memorialisation were answered in the path of a river, the flight of a kestrel,&nbsp;or the contours of a broken wall. &quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In his quest for understanding, <strong>Landings </strong>demonstrates the importance of&nbsp;continuing the development of our relationships with place, and with the natural&nbsp;world. How many of us are aware that the rise and fall of the river mirrors our own&nbsp;internal struggles, that the changing of the seasons can mark a transformation&nbsp;in our own cycles of growth and development? A bond once highly cherished is&nbsp;commonly forgotten.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s an inherently spiritual quest: to understand the places we find ourselves&nbsp;occupying, to deepen our connection to them and to honour them somehow.&nbsp;There follows the desire to leave our own mark upon the land, to incorporate it&nbsp;into our world, and to make the unfamiliar familiar once more.</div>
