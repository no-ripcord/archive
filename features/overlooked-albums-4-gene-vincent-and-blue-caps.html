  <p>The almost self-titled <strong>Gene Vincent and The Blue Caps</strong> was the band&rsquo;s second album. It was&nbsp;the product of two forces at play: Vincent&lsquo;s wild vocal <span word="stylings" data-scaytid="2">stylings</span> and Cliff Gallup&rsquo;s&nbsp;virtuoso lead guitar. Though different in so many ways, both men were giving shape&nbsp;to a new form. The record had a huge impact, especially in the UK, where a new generation of guitar gunslingers, such as Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, learned the&nbsp;basics figuring out Gallup&rsquo;s fingering techniques.</p>
<div>Gene Vincent had a reputation as a troublemaker that dated from his stint in the&nbsp;Navy. The sailor lifestyle was fatefully cut short when a lady ran a red light and&nbsp;smashed into Vincent&rsquo;s motorcycle, leaving him with a severely damaged left leg&nbsp;and a lifetime of constant pain. The stiff leg never hindered him; it actually gave&nbsp;Vincent a unique stage presence: he pivoted on the leg as he seduced the audience&nbsp;into a frenzy. He could overhaul old standards with hoots, hollers, hiccups, and&nbsp;moans. There was a raw sexuality to his singing that Elvis only hinted at. Vincent&nbsp;was downright horny, and it made him the target of preachers and censors, who&nbsp;kept songs such as <em>Woman Love</em> out of the charts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Gene Vincent and The Blue Caps</strong> was to be Gallup&rsquo;s last album with the band.&nbsp;Homesick after endless months of touring, he had already quit the band to return&nbsp;to his young wife. When time came to record the album, the band was still&nbsp;scrambling for a suitable replacement, so Gallup decided to step in as a favor. It&nbsp;would be his <span word="swansong" data-scaytid="3">swansong</span>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The group&rsquo;s second album improves over their first, <strong><span word="Bluejean" data-scaytid="4">Bluejean</span> Bop</strong> (1956), which&nbsp;relied too much on old standards. This one regales us with a remarkable collection of hard rocking originals like <em>Red Blue Jeans and a Ponytail</em>, <em>Cat Man</em>, and <em>You Better&nbsp;Believe</em>. Perversely, none of the hits are here (songs like <em>Be-Bop-A-Lula</em> and <em>Race&nbsp;With The Devil</em> were singles only), but there is a grit and gusto to the performances&nbsp;that make this the zenith of rockabilly. This was a band letting loose in the studio,&nbsp;playing live with a touch of tape delay. <span word="Dickie" data-scaytid="5">Dickie</span> Harrell was a master of the snare&nbsp;drum and his rebel yells still send chills to my spine. A personal favorite is <em>Cruising</em>,&nbsp;where a fast beat and red-hot guitar runs give the song so much propulsion you&nbsp;want to grease your hair and join a hot rod gang.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The key player was Cliff Gallup. There was virtually no tradition to the electric&nbsp;guitar then; players like Scotty Moore and Gallup kept inventing as they went&nbsp;along, borrowing from Les Paul, Chet Atkins and Chicago blues, and adding noise&nbsp;and swagger to the mix. Gallup made it look simple, but to this day there a few&nbsp;performers with the dexterity to recreate his descending and ascending notes.&nbsp;He never suspected he was laying the groundwork for future players.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Johnny Meeks replaced Gallup, and the band went on to record a third album for&nbsp;Capitol before disbanding at the end of 1958. If anyone got rich at the end of nearly four years at Capitol, not Gene or the band. Most fifties artists were&nbsp;bilked out of millions through shady promoters and creative accounting. Even Elvis,&nbsp;who made a fortune, was scammed by The Colonel. At that point Vincent owed a&nbsp;sizeable debt to the IRS, and America&rsquo;s attention was focused on manufactured pop&nbsp;idols like Fabian. Vincent, a <span word="bluesman" data-scaytid="6">bluesman</span> at heart, sought greener pastures and moved&nbsp;to Britain, where he was given a hero&rsquo;s welcome by hordes of impressionable fans.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A leather-clad Vincent was a product for England, becoming the poster boy for&nbsp;greasers and teddy boys. Major chart hits followed until fate intervened once again.&nbsp;A late night ride from Bristol to London ended in tragedy when the taxi that carried&nbsp;Vincent and his pal, the great Eddie Cochran, hit a cement post. Cochran died instantly and Vincent&rsquo;s leg was re-injured. After that, the quality of his recordings</div>
<div>suffered. Old fans formed bands and started replacing him in the charts. He was a&nbsp;man out of time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There would be no new recordings from Vincent from 1964 to 1966. Eighteen months were enough to turn him invisible to a cold record industry, and any effort&nbsp;to restart his career was met with indifference from a public who had long since&nbsp;moved on. He died of a ruptured ulcer at the ripe age of 36.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cliff Gallup never pursued a rock n&rsquo; roll career. At the time of his death in 1980,&nbsp;he was the director of maintenance and transportation for his local high school&nbsp;system. This pillar of the community still loved to play and died of a heart attack&nbsp;after a gig. He was a humble man who was baffled by the attention paid to him&nbsp;by people like George Harrison and Jeff Beck. He had managed to escape the pain, &nbsp;&nbsp;heartbreak, and suffering Vincent went through. Perhaps he was better off.</div>
