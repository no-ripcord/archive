  <p>I&#39;m kicking back on a leather sofa in the upstairs lounge area of a tour bus, conspicuously parked in a side street in the <span word="centre" data-scaytid="2">centre</span> of Gloucester. &nbsp;I have a can of Red Stripe in one hand and my recording equipment in the other. &nbsp;Opposite me is Chris Cain, vocalist and bass player for We Are Scientists, one of the most popular American indie-rock bands to break through in recent years. &nbsp;He&#39;s standing, trying to work a ceiling window. &nbsp;He explains that the band have only just started the tour and so have yet to get used to the &quot;quirks&quot; of the bus.</p>
<p>The band have just returned from playing an energetic and crowd-pleasing set on stage at Gloucester&#39;s first Park:Live festival. &nbsp;It&#39;s been the first sunny weekend to grace the UK for a couple of months, and so many have been at the festival all day, enjoying the free music and local cider under the welcome blue skies. &nbsp;The jewel in a day of live performances, We Are Scientists play as the sun sets over an appreciative audience, who are singing along to the hits and enjoying We Are Scientists&#39; trademark onstage banter. &nbsp;It&#39;s an enjoyable end to a <span word="well-organised" data-scaytid="4">well-organised</span> and, ultimately, very successful festival.</p>
<p>Chris opens the window and takes a seat. &nbsp;The interview begins:</p>
<p><strong>With the lighting on this tour bus, it feels like we&#39;re going to have a very intimate interview. It&#39;s going to be a beautiful thing...</strong></p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p><strong>What do you have on this tour bus? How much do you have onboard? Is there a shower somewhere onboard, for example?</strong></p>
<p>No, no. This is a pretty bare-bones tour bus. Although I suppose they must even make some without TVs and this one has two small TVs. And you see how this is two bunks? A <span word="single-decker" data-scaytid="5">single-decker</span> bus with two bunks high would be the most luxurious sleeping environment. With a <span word="single-decker" data-scaytid="6">single-decker</span>, the top of the bus would be higher, so you get a little more room that way.</p>
<p><strong>And do you fight over who gets top bunk?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, on this tour we only have five people, including the band, so we can all have whatever the hell we want. For some reason, we got a bus that&#39;s suited to a large crew, and it gives us a lot of real estate. So what it lacks in luxury, it makes up for in space. It&#39;s like people living in the American West.</p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s like a Winnebago, or something. It makes you feel at home, maybe?</strong></p>
<p>No. My home is nothing like this. For starters, I don&#39;t have blue running lights along the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>So what do you do on board a tour bus? You must spend many an hour on here, no doubt.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally you try to limit your activities on the bus to sleeping, because it is not very fun. You try to arrange the drives to happen whilst everyone&#39;s asleep. And that&#39;s what a tour bus offers. It&#39;s far less comfortable than sleeping in a hotel room, or even on someone&#39;s couch to be honest. What it does do is make it so that you don&#39;t have to spend every day driving. You wake up in your next destination and you can have a day and walk around, which is great. That is one of the luxuries. It&#39;s actually not at all pleasant to sleep whilst you&#39;re jostling around and driving, and the bunks are pretty shitty. So it&#39;s not comfortable, but it wins you time.</p>
<p><strong>And what do you do with that time? Will you be spending time on the road writing?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don&#39;t do writing on the road, really. We&#39;re not road-writers. We like to go to the cinema with our free time. We like to walk around the town that we&#39;re in and check it out. That&#39;s actually something that&#39;s really frustrating about being a touring musician. You go to all these places and a lot of the time you don&#39;t really get to see them. You see the inside of the club, backstage and you&#39;re in a lot of airports. Everyone&#39;s always asking, &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;, and the answer is that we&#39;ve been to pretty much every city you can name. But many of them I have not seen at all. And it&#39;s almost worse to go to, say, Leipzig and not see it. You feel like an idiot when you say, &ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;ve been to Leipzig.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yeah, what&#39;s it like?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; It&#39;s frustrating. So the bus lets you wake up in these places and hang out.</p>
<p><strong>I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve spent four minutes talking about the tour bus, rather than the actual music!</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s important that people hear this.</p>
<p><strong>It is important. And it&#39;s not every day that you get to be on We Are Scientists&#39; tour bus, so I&#39;m very grateful. Your performance tonight, was it the first time you&#39;ve headlined a festival?</strong></p>
<p>We&#39;ve headlined small festivals in the States before, once or twice. But this was our first time in the UK. This tour that we&#39;re on, it&#39;s a lot of smaller festivals. So we&#39;re much closer to the top of the bill than we would be at a Reading or Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>And was that a conscious decision? Did you want to play more intimate festivals? Because I notice that you&#39;re not doing Reading or Leeds this time round, plus you&#39;re not doing V Festival or any of the other big festivals.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it was a conscious decision. At this stage in our career, we&#39;re not a hot &ldquo;brand-new&rdquo; band, like someone like The Vaccines were last year, a year and a half ago. So it&#39;s better not to play Reading and Leeds every year. This is our off-year. We played those festivals last summer and next year, we&#39;ll play the large festivals again. But we didn&#39;t want to just not tour, we wanted to do a tour.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering whether the decision to tour at more intimate venues was so you would have a chance to try out some new material?</strong></p>
<p>It is, yeah. It&#39;s also a million times more fun to play intimate venues. I think the ideal size from our perspective is somewhere around 500 to 1,000 in a club, that&#39;s the best. Festivals always sound kind of bad, because they&#39;re outdoors. But they&#39;re fun for different reasons. Everyone&#39;s high on crack cocaine and acting insane and soaked in their own piss and mud... I&#39;m not talking about us! But it&#39;s fun to see a crowd of people who are essentially apocalypse survivors right in front of you, that&#39;s quite a kick.</p>
<p><strong>From an audience perspective, it&#39;s amazing to watch your live shows because you always seem to have fun onstage, especially with your banter.</strong></p>
<p>We do have a lot of fun. That&#39;s definitely the driving force behind the band, it always has been. It&#39;s just that we love playing live. And we always write our songs to be fun to play live. We all like slower, prettier music as well as more up-tempo rock stuff, but I don&#39;t think we have any interest in being a band like Death Cab For Cutie, even though I really like them.</p>
<p><strong>I can&#39;t imagine you ever performing Bon Iver type music.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. I really like those guys. In fact, my iPod is probably more stocked with stuff like that than rock. But we&#39;re all big rock fans as well.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you liking at the moment? Which bands are you discovering as you tour?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we&#39;ve been off the road for roughly a year now, so probably a bad time for me to try and give you a current live act that I like. Actually, there&#39;s a band called Capsula, that we played with in Bogotá, Colombia in February and subsequently, we hung out with them a lot and they were super super awesome. I played bass on a covers album that they just did. They covered Ziggy Stardust. It&#39;s a fucking awesome record, and they&#39;re an amazing live band. They definitely make us look rough! They&#39;re awesome because they&#39;re super-energetic and crazy and improvise constantly. That&#39;s a band to catch live if you ever get the chance, they definitely come to the UK every once in a while.</p>
<p>But in terms of recorded music, I really like the new Gossip record. I didn&#39;t want to like it. I was like, &ldquo;Oh, fuck the Gossip.&rdquo; I don&#39;t know why. I think I get jealous of bands that do well. But I listened to it and was like &ldquo;Holy shit, that&#39;s a great record!&rdquo; And there&#39;s a band called Au Revoir Simone, which is made up of three-year olds. We&#39;ve toured with them before. And one of them has a solo project, Erika Spring. She just came out with an EP and I&#39;m amazed at how good it is. Not because I have low expectations for her but because it&#39;s even better than I was expecting.</p>
<p><strong>And in terms of your music, the three of you, we were talking earlier about experimenting with a few new tracks and trying them out live. Does that mean that there is a lot of music ready to be released, and is there a release plan in mind?</strong></p>
<p>So we played three new songs tonight. We have the album worked out in our heads and we&#39;ve recorded a lot of it. We&#39;re going to finish recording and then mix it this fall. For scheduling reasons, for us and the producer, this amazing dude called Chris Coady, we&#39;ve had to do some this summer and some this fall. And we&#39;re hoping to release it next spring. March seems like a good possibility. We don&#39;t know how we&#39;re putting it out. We did our last record on our own label, through a fantastic company called PIAS (Play It Again Sam). They distribute most of the indies in Europe and the UK. And they&#39;ve also started acting as a label, so we may do a label deal with them. But no-one&#39;s actually heard any songs, neither PIAS nor anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Apart from us, we heard a few new songs tonight...</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we&#39;ve played them live a couple of times. But I don&#39;t think the PIAS folks have been to any shows where we&#39;ve played the new stuff. But we have really nice sounding demos, which is a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>And most importantly, there&#39;s always the comedy element &ndash; it&#39;s not always necessarily prevalent but it&#39;s always bubbling under. We&#39;ve had <em>Crap Attack</em> and <em>Barbara</em> (which is quite possibly the best name ever for an album). Are you going to go for an equally light-hearted title for the new album, do you think?</strong></p>
<p>We&#39;ve not decided on the album title yet. We&#39;ve got a couple of front-runners, but I feel like we need to finish recording it before we can be sure.</p>
<p><strong>You may get this next question asked of you a lot, you may never get it asked of you. <em>Goal! England</em> &ndash; why wasn&#39;t it re-released for the Euros this year? For me, it&#39;s the perfect song to encourage people to get behind England and I didn&#39;t hear it at all this year...what&#39;s up with that?!</strong></p>
<p>Man...blame the BBC! It&#39;s available. In fact, we never put it on sale, it&#39;s always just been free. It remains free to download.</p>
<p><strong>You know, I was trying to secure an interview with you guys earlier on in the week and if I&#39;d had it confirmed, I would have brought with me a pack of England party hats and streamers that you could have used at some sort of future sporting event. How amazing would that have been?!</strong></p>
<p>That would have been great.</p>
<p><strong>Can you imagine anything better?</strong></p>
<p>Not involving flare and sporting events. I can imagine better things in the world though.</p>
<p><strong>Not many though, right? I think we need some sort of <em>Goal! England</em> campaign, and I promise you, I will do my part.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like at this point, it&#39;s up to the fans. We wrote the song, we recorded it and made it available. Now, we don&#39;t actually work with or for the English national football team. It&#39;s in the public domain now, it&#39;s for everyone to either play or not play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there you have it. &nbsp;We must all do our part to make&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McG4fEnkZlA"><em>Goal! England</em></a> the official England football song. &nbsp;It&#39;s probably too late for the Olympics, so maybe for World Cup 2014. &nbsp;But it needs to happen, if for no other reason than to avoid another &quot;thirty years&quot; of Three Lions. &nbsp;Who&#39;s with me?</p>
