  <div>Beckett. Pynchon. Gaddis. Joyce. Barth. Proust. Burroughs. Wallace. Ghostface. Few other rappers could be so comfortably placed amongst those authors, their work so analogous to books like <strong>The Recognitions</strong> or <strong>Finnegans Wake</strong> in how they utilize words to convey meaning and emotion, overwhelming and abstract. On no album is this better evidenced than in 2000&rsquo;s <strong>Supreme Clientele</strong>. If you&rsquo;ve never heard it, let me give you a taste:&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are dense lyricists, and then there&rsquo;s Dennis Coles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ghostface Killah&rsquo;s sophomore solo effort is something you let wash over yourself, exactly in the spirit of stream-of-consciousness classics like <strong>Ulysses</strong>. It&rsquo;s one of those monumental works of art that you know full well going into you&rsquo;ll only ever be able to partially decipher. As Jeff Weiss pointed out in his tremendous retrospective essay about the album for Pitchfork back in 2017, <em>&ldquo;You can see, feel, and taste it, but it can only be decrypted to a point.&rdquo;</em> Though I was already familiar with Ghostface&rsquo;s more conventional masterpiece <strong>FishScale (2006)</strong>, I hadn&rsquo;t yet experienced <strong>Clientele</strong> and was intrigued by Weiss&rsquo; article. I was still in college around that time as a Literature major, and was obsessed with, for lack of a better term, the &ldquo;long-winded shit&rdquo;: your <strong>Gravity&rsquo;s Rainbow-s</strong>, your <strong>Infinite Jest-s</strong>, your <strong>Sound and the Fury-s</strong>, your <strong>J R-s</strong> and such. My favorite feeling to experience while studying was getting locked in this state of flow where what I was reading propelled right off the page and into my brain at a breakneck pace, even if it wasn&rsquo;t easy or didn&rsquo;t make complete sense. Some of my most rewarding, treasured moments of academia came from notoriously difficult novels. And upon learning of this fascinating chapter in the Wu-Tang solo saga, how the album was recorded after the RZA&rsquo;s studio flooded and Ghost&rsquo;s trip to Africa deeply affected his artistic outlook (I implore you to read Weiss&rsquo; <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23207-supreme-clientele/">piece</a> to find out more), I came to obsess over <strong>Supreme Clientele</strong> the same way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is, of course, no shortage of challenging albums, either. It&rsquo;s a badge of honor for music dorks to say they made it through Autechre&rsquo;s <strong>elseq </strong>or Swans&rsquo; <strong>Soundtracks for the Blind</strong> the same way it&rsquo;s a badge of honor for literary nerds to say they finished War and Peace. But Supreme Clientele isn&rsquo;t challenging because of a taxing runtime&mdash;it&rsquo;s only an hour long. Rather, it&rsquo;s challenging because of how it approaches language as a means of engagement. Nearly every track here rejects any preconceived notions of what a rap song is supposed to be about, or whether or not it even needs to be &ldquo;about&rdquo; anything&mdash;though, when you listen to these tracks, you still feel like something poignant is being said.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This becomes apparent the moment the album&rsquo;s 40-second introductory skit ends and <em>Nutmeg</em> begins, where Ghostface lets fly a barrage of splatter-paint verbiage and dome-scorching street vernacular: <em>&ldquo;Scientific, my hand kissed it/ Robotic, let&#39;s think optimistic/ You probably missed it, watch me Dolly Dick it/ Scotty Wotty copped it to me, big microphone hippie/ Hit Poughkeepsie, crispy chicken, verbs, throw up a stone, Richie.&rdquo;</em> Ghost&rsquo;s iconic opening verse on <em>Bring da Ruckus</em> from the Wu&rsquo;s <strong>Enter the Wu-Tang</strong> (<strong>36 Chambers)</strong> is undeniable, sure, but the bars that announce Clientele&rsquo;s arrival set the tone for the LP in a way no other hip hop album starter ever has. Those aren&rsquo;t lyrics; they&rsquo;re a fucking mission statement from the fifth dimension.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But what&rsquo;s most amazing to me about <strong>Supreme Clientele</strong> is that, despite its unapologetic use of slang and its raw, neverending spools of lyrics that mercilessly fire at the listener from all angles, it never feels arduous. In fact, it&rsquo;s bizarrely fun to listen to. There are plenty of hip hop albums with complex rhyme schemes, syllabic gymnastics, and surreal imagery that I haven&rsquo;t returned to anywhere near as often as I have <strong>Clientele</strong>. It&rsquo;s an album that gets its rocks off on puzzling and bewildering you while absorbing and entrancing you at the same time. Once it&rsquo;s over, you desperately want to play through it again because you know Ghost told you something amazing. You&rsquo;re just not quite sure what it was, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I&rsquo;ve completely figured it out myself.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And what&rsquo;s the best compliment to otherworldly rhymes? Otherworldly production. Describing this album&rsquo;s instrumentals is arguably trickier than describing its lyrics, which says a lot. It has shades of the RZA&rsquo;s classic, off-kilter, sample-heavy beatmaking, which is hardcoded in the DNA of all Wu-based music, but it also isn&rsquo;t completely exemplative of &ldquo;old school&rdquo; East Coast hip hop. If you asked me to place a year on <strong>Supreme Clientele</strong> after hearing it for the first time with no prior knowledge of its release date, I honestly don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to give a definitive answer. The LP sounds metallic, crisp, and futuristic, but also strange, obtuse, and distorted. Look no further than the twisted, looped-into-oblivion record scratch that makes up the entirety of the beat on <em>Stroke of Death</em>&mdash;a favorite of comedian Chris Rock, who quipped of that track, <em>&ldquo;It makes you want to stab your babysitter.&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Indeed, I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s been another rap album quite like <strong>Supreme Clientele</strong> since it dropped at the turn of the new millennium. There certainly wasn&rsquo;t one before it. A lot has changed about the culture of hip hop in the two decades since it came out, but <strong>Clientele</strong> stands timeless as an indestructible minaret of verse that no artist dare try to topple. It&rsquo;s a Portrait of the Rapper as an Unstoppable Force. As Tony Stark. As Iron Man.&nbsp;</div>
