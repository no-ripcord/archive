  <p><strong>Parquet Courts Live at 285 Kent, Brooklyn NY</strong></p>
<p><strong>2/2/13</strong></p>
<p>Ok, before you all get pissed at me for being so fucking lame, you&rsquo;ve got to know that, in the words of countless action stars, I&rsquo;m getting too old for this shit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 45 years old and in no position to be trawling bars and desolate spaces in the middle of the night looking for the next big thing.&nbsp; So what I&rsquo;m about to tell you should be understood in this context.</p>
<p>I was in NYC for a little R&amp;R, eating some good food, buying some books and records and checking out <span word="MoMA" data-scaytid="10">MoMA</span> to see Munch&rsquo;s The Scream, among other works of art that make a whole lot less sense.&nbsp; Shortly before leaving for the very large apple, I was informed by my <span word="fiancée" data-scaytid="2">fiancée</span>, who would of course be accompanying me, that a band I had recently raved about would be playing live in Brooklyn this very same weekend.&nbsp; The band was the Parquet Courts, whose debut album received a <a href="../reviews/music/parquet-courts/light-gold.html">favorable review on this site</a>, and whose music was on heavy rotation on my iPod.&nbsp; After an unsuccessful attempt to secure an interview with the band (unsuccessful because the press dude seemed to have forgotten about me and I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to be a pain in the ass about it), I got our tickets online, napped in the early evening after a long, long day, <span word="chowed" data-scaytid="3">chowed</span> down on some soup dumplings at Shanghai <span word="Café" data-scaytid="4">Café</span>, and set off for the wilds of Williamsburg.&nbsp; I had timed this perfectly, so I thought.&nbsp; There were four bands on the bill and the Courts were to go on last.&nbsp; The tickets informed me, or rather misinformed me, that the show would begin at 8:00 pm, so I did a quick calculation that told me each band would be allowed about an hour including set up and breakdown, yielding a Courts arrival time of approximately 11:00.&nbsp; We showed up around 10:15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let me be clear that at this point in my life, starting my evening at 10:15 is usually a non-starter; most of the time I&rsquo;d like to be winding things up by then.&nbsp; So this was kind of a special night, anticipating seeing the band that I&rsquo;d been reveling in for days.</p>
<p>So <span word="anyways" data-scaytid="5">anyways</span>, we stroll into a moderately crowded, small, industrial-looking space, with a corrugated metal ceiling and dilapidated chairs against the wall.&nbsp; The place had been spruced up with some creative painting and gave the impression of a very cool venue to see a punk band.&nbsp; Our spirits were high.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;our spirits&rdquo; because we were in a room full of dictionary-picture hipsters who by definition don&rsquo;t give a shit about anything, being ironically distanced from the art produced by mere humans.&nbsp; This pose is interesting because while remaining superior to everything around them, they also have to appear supportive of the right things, which leads to a high wire act of dampened enthusiasm that is disconcerting to someone like me, used to singing along with full-throated abandon to <em>Badlands</em> at Springsteen shows.&nbsp; This vibe is unfortunately addictive, and pretty soon we are both getting a little grumbly while three young gentlemen play/program some kind of techno beat that refuses to vary for 45 minutes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fine, because no one is really listening, except for the musicians, who seem blissfully unaware that any other people are present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next up, there&rsquo;s another band &ndash; this one with a girl playing a violin and a couple other guys playing actual instruments, though beats appear programmed.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know the name of any of these bands since no-one introduced them and as far as I can tell they never mention who they are.&nbsp; Again, fine with me.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t care if I know who they are, neither do I.&nbsp; But at this point I&rsquo;m getting a little antsy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s coming on midnight as this band wraps up and I&rsquo;m wondering if the Courts are coming on next.&nbsp; You have to realize, this place is now jam packed with dudes and their purses full of God knows what, I&rsquo;ve been going at full speed since 9 in the morning, and I&rsquo;m simply not digging the preview fare offered up on this chilly, snowy evening in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Soon we become aware, perhaps through osmosis, that, no, the Courts will not be up next.&nbsp; It hits us, hard, that we are in the city that never sleeps, bars stay open until whenever in the morning, and the band I came to see might not be going on until sometime after 1, if we&rsquo;re lucky.&nbsp; The same notion occurs to both of us at the same time &ndash; fuck it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got plenty to do tomorrow, including <span word="travelling" data-scaytid="6">travelling</span> six hours to get home, and this just ain&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp; We hurry outside and catch the first cab we see back to the hotel.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the Courts were great because their record has many fairly awesome moments on it, and you should all go out and get it on vinyl.&nbsp; They say the darkest hour is just before the dawn, but it&rsquo;s no time for an old dude like me to see a band.&nbsp; Maybe some day they&rsquo;ll play at a place offering an early bird special, and you can guess who&rsquo;ll be the first senior in line to see them.</p>
