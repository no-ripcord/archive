  <p>Hi everyone, and welcome to our latest installment of Quick Takes!</p>
<p>We took a break last month, but now we&#39;re back and we&#39;re bigger than ever. Well, not quite&mdash;I was long overdue a break, so this month, it&#39;s mostly playing catch-up with some albums that caught my attention during the last two months (including Eve Owen&#39;s stellar debut). Mark, Sean, and Ethan also contributed some picks. There&#39;s plenty to choose from, and you absolutely can&#39;t go wrong with any of these even if the quality of each varies somewhat.</p>
<p>What were your favorite albums during April and May? Anything we didn&#39;t get to review that we should&#39;ve? You can always reach us on<a href="https://www.facebook.com/noripcordmagazine"> Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/noripcordmag/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, or our official <a href="https://twitter.com/noripcord">Twitter</a> page.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Austra.jpg" /><strong>Austra</strong><br /><em>HiRUDiN</em><br />(Domino)</p>
<p>Don&#39;t let the head-scratching album title fool you. Austra&#39;s fourth studio album is named after a peptide in the salivary glands of blood-sucking leeches, which is a very artistic way of saying that relationships can be a drag. These high concepts come second nature to Katie Stelmanis, who previously wrote about the murky relationship between environmentalism and technology in 2017&#39;s <strong>Future Politics</strong>. Here, Stelmanis eases her previous album&#39;s four-on-the-floor dance beats and builds upon off-center synth arrangements with hints of classical music (even if they feel commonplace when compared to the rest of her body of work). She&#39;s a vibrant presence on <em>Anywayz</em>&nbsp;and <em>How Did You Know</em>, pushing her operatic vocals over soaring, anthemic choruses. But that&#39;s not enough to save an album that, despite sounding so busy and hectic, fails to generate much excitement&mdash;even if Stelmanis&#39; emotional downward spiral is compelling in the lyrical sense. &nbsp;<strong>[6/10]&nbsp;</strong><em>Juan Edgardo Rodríguez</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Eve%20Owen.jpg" /><strong>Eve Owen</strong><br /><em>Don&#39;t Let the Ink Dry</em><br />(37d03d)</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t Let the Ink Dry</strong> was a difficult album to make for Eve Owen. The London singer-songwriter wasn&#39;t in a good mental state during the recording of her debut album, struggling with her confidence while also dropping out of school and discovering she had Asperger&#39;s syndrome. It&#39;s a lot to take in for the 20-year-old, who confronts all her demons head-on through haunting, intricate folk songs in the vein of artists like Jesca Hoop, Laura Veirs, and even early Sharon Van Etten. But Owen is a formidable talent in her own right&mdash;as <em>For Redemption</em>&nbsp;and <em>After the Love</em>&nbsp;show, she has a firm grasp of how she layers her fingerpicked compositions over each song&#39;s dark ambient soundscapes. On <em>So Still for You</em>, she wishes to find herself against a partner&#39;s wishes as she lays out a placid country-rock melody. Owen makes it look easy with her articulate songwriting&mdash;and though taking many cues from The National&#39;s Aaron Dessner (who produced the album) in sonic terms, she deftly controls her somber arrangements with a depth that is wise beyond her years. <strong>[8/10]</strong> <em>Juan Edgardo Rodríguez</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/EZRAT.jpg" /><strong>EZRAT</strong><br /><em>Carousel</em><br />(self-released)</p>
<p>After two excellent releases under NYC label tastemakers Captured Tracks, ex-Brooklyn trio EZTV never quite stood a chance. Coming around during a time when laptop enthusiasts were trying to save rock n&#39; roll from total extinction with programming software, the Ezra Tenenbaum-led band were writing soaring jangle/power-pop songs that stood adjacent to all the noise. It&#39;s hard to say who ultimately won that war, but there&#39;s always a place for guitars&mdash;and Tenenbaum, alongside former drummer Michael Stasiak, quietly reformed under the name Ezrat with a little help from their friends. They describe their new project as a &quot;simple twist of lemon&quot; on their Bandcamp page, and there&#39;s some truth to that&mdash;on songs like <em>Yellow Flowers</em> and <em>Distortions</em>, Tenenbaum shares like-minded stories of romantic dissolution and afternoon ennui over gently-strummed melodies. But there&#39;s also a looseness to their debut album, <strong>Carousel</strong>, that implies Ezrat wanted to broaden their scope, like on <em>Daydream</em>, where the band incorporates light jazzy elements and horns over Tenenbaum&#39;s soft-spoken vocal delivery. The elegantly composed <em>Loud Sounds</em> is anything but raucous, allowing Tenenbaum and his cohorts to follow the sunshine pop-meets-baroque approach of sixties bands like The Left Banke and The Peppermint Trolly Company. Unlike those groups, though, let&#39;s hope that Ezrat manages to artistically flourish rather than remain in obscurity until an archival record label features them on some compilation in thirty-years&#39; time.<strong> [7/10] </strong><em>Juan Edgardo Rodríguez</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Antarctica.jpg" /><strong>Flat Worms</strong><br /><em>Antarctica</em><br />(God? Records)</p>
<p>Flat Worms, an Angelino post-Aughts indie rock group with a propulsive bass throb and a propensity for dissonant drama, has released their third album, <strong>Antarctica</strong>. The place itself is meant to invoke a sense of isolation; an allegory not too far removed from where people find themselves of late. Comparable to the recent guitar-oriented trips generated by bands like Parquet Courts and Protomartyr, Flat Worms lead into this listen with the anthemic track <em>The Aughts</em>, a solid grab that&rsquo;s invigorated by the up-tempo sway of Plaster Casts and the single Market Forces. It&rsquo;s a strong cluster of songs slowed up by the title track and the strangled frets of <em>Via</em>, the point at which<strong> Antarctica</strong> loses some of its steam. Recorded by Steve Albini, the Shellac&rsquo;ish touches of <em>The Mine</em>, the sturdy <em>Wet Concrete</em>, and the album&rsquo;s finale, <em>Terms of Visitation</em>, provide plenty for listeners to enjoy. But, Antarctica, itself a seldom-visited location, is rife with ground that&rsquo;s already been well-traveled. <strong>[6/10]</strong> <em>Sean Caldwell</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/GRID.jpg" /><strong>GRID</strong><br /><em>Decomposing Force</em><br />(NNA Tapes)</p>
<p>The improvised discordance captured within the grooves of <strong>Decomposing Force</strong>, a four-track treatise to violent jazz performed by GRID, meets somewhere between Albert Ayler, Jooklo Duo, and Prurient. GRID, sax player Matt Nelson (Battle Trance; Elder Ones), bassist Tim Dahl (Child Abuse; Lydia Lunch Retrovirus), and drummer Nick Podgurski (New Firmament; Feast of the Epiphany) pull the free jazz idiom (if such a word can be applied to a structureless artform) into an electrified maelstrom of power electronics and percussive arrhythmia. The immediately aggressive <em>Brutal Kings&rsquo;</em> rampant instrumentation is as minimalist as this album gets, chunky bass scrubs and wild-sax noodling sounds that eventually devolve into something close to the dueling array of distorted scrapes, swipes, and rapid pulsars that comprise <em>Nythynge</em>. <em>The Weight of Literacy</em> comes dangerously close to rhythmic alignment, airy drones, and faraway brass, adding shiver to tension as the volume increases. <em>Cold Sleep</em> swells with dissonance, atonal buzz, and howl stretching across its 12-minute runtime as the occasional bump of stick-to-drum caps off GRID&rsquo;s textural explorations. <em>Sean Caldwell</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Kehlani.jpg" /><strong>Kehlani</strong><br /><em>It Was Good Until It Wasn&#39;t</em><br />(TSNMI/Atlantic)</p>
<p>On Kehlani&rsquo;s best song,&nbsp;<em>Distraction</em>, she summarized what was so appealing about her breezy, sleek style in the past. Her memorable vocals combined nicely with a skittering beat to tell a story about a sunny fling. It was appealing as a lovely pop song with a great hook; a distraction. With her sophomore record,<strong> It Was Good Until It Wasn&rsquo;t</strong>, Kehlani replaces any hint of controlled pop presence with a lowkey, gloomy vibe that doesn&rsquo;t suit her strengths at all. Her raspy voice is now placed upon liquid synth bass and irritating trap production, leaving her songwriting to be the record&rsquo;s only strength. The slinky <em>Water</em> feels less sexy than depressing, with dark pianos and bothersome percussion distracting from anything Kehlani was doing well. The album&rsquo;s strongest streak starts with the smooth <em>Hate the Club</em> and concludes on the brief <em>F&amp;MU</em>, but even with those momentary highs, the album doesn&rsquo;t stick in any cohesive way. It feels slapdash and disorganized in the way a lot of Kehlani&rsquo;s material has, but this is even worse than usual. <strong>[5/10]</strong> <em>Ethan Gordon</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user347/Shannon&#32;Lay.jpg" /><strong>Shannon Lay</strong><br /><em>Live at Zebulon</em><br />(Sub Pop)</p>
<p>By all accounts, L.A. based singer-songwriter Shannon Lay had a great 2019. She signed to Sub Pop and released her third solo album, <strong>August</strong>, managed to pull off a pre-COVID U.S. and European tour, and at the dawn of the new decade, was able to amicably split from her longtime band, Feels. Of course, 2020 is a different matter altogether, but Lay has kept herself busy with numerous livestream events, a full-length tour videologue, and most importantly, a quietly released live album, <strong>Live At Zebulon</strong>. The album pulls from all three of her solo albums as well as some select covers. The two songs pulled from her debut album are particularly impressive here (<em>Parked</em> is a dolorous delight), showing the depth of her ability from early on. As she did in August, Lay shows herself as a more than capable bandleader, with Mikal Cronin joining in on sax for at least one song. <strong>Live At Zebulon</strong> is at its best the further it strays from Lay&rsquo;s more mystical early leanings and shows a depth and warmth even in the simplest of songs. Case in point is her band&rsquo;s full-throated chorus on a reworked cover of Black Box&rsquo;s Euro-pop hit <em>Everybody, Everybody</em> as the album&rsquo;s closer. As good a spot as any to get on board. <strong>[8/10]</strong> <em>Mark Moody</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Sparta.jpg" /><strong>Sparta</strong><br /><em>Trust the River</em><br />(Dine Alone Records)</p>
<p>Even at their most accomplished, Sparta struggled to stand apart from their El Paso counterparts At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta. The Jim Ward-led post-hardcore band was by far the most tuneful and potentially commercial out of all three; too &quot;pop&quot; by comparison, if you will, causing that collective rabid fanbase to split up for good and never to return. Ward was content with following his own heart, even going as far as pursuing a folk/alt-country project (Sleepercar) that didn&#39;t quite reach a larger audience because it was too inward-looking. Fourteen years later, Ward felt the time was right to revive the Sparta name once he realized that songs like <em>Cat Scream</em> and <em>Graveyard Luck</em> followed that band&#39;s more visceral side. But Ward&#39;s more sensitive songwriting side remains, and all the better for it, as <em>Empty Houses</em>&nbsp;and <em>Turquoise Dream</em>&nbsp;conform to the shimmering guitar dynamics and mid-tempo stompers of previous albums (albeit with more modest production techniques). But at its core, <strong>Trust the River </strong>raises politically-charged concerns while running another narrative altogether: Ward&#39;s artistic growth and creative balance. <strong>[7/10]</strong> <em>Juan Edgardo Rodríguez</em></p>
