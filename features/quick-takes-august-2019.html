  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to our latest installment of Quick Takes!</p>
<p>I have to say that August and September (so far) have been two of the best months in terms of music releases. We&#39;ve covered many of them in the main reviews section, so make sure to give those a read. In the meantime, this month&#39;s feature is a little bit different. We&#39;ve got two longer-than-usual takes by regular contributors Mark and Kirk, both positive takes on Ty Segall and Belle and Sebastian (we normally cover the month prior, but I felt like sneaking in a new release this time). As for myself, I was very happy with The Futureheads&#39; comeback album&mdash;as well as the new Pete Yorn, an artist we&#39;ve covered numerous times throughout the years. And if you&#39;ve felt that our regular QT&#39;s are showered in 6&#39;s and 7&#39;s, well you&#39;ll be happy to find out that this one has a couple of low scores. I&#39;ll let you all figure out which ones they are.</p>
<p>What were your favorite albums during the month of August? Anything we didn&#39;t get to review that we should&#39;ve? You can always reach us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noripcordmagazine">Facebook</a>, or on our official <a href="https://www.twitter.com/noripcord">twitter</a> page. - <em>Juan</em></p>

<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/B%20and%20S.jpg" /><strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong><br /><em>Days of the Bagnold Summer</em><br />(Matador)</p>
<p>For their tenth studio album, Belle and Sebastian have produced the soundtrack to the film <strong>Days Of The Bagnold Summer</strong>. The movie, directed by Simon Bird, is an adaptation of Joff Winterhart&rsquo;s graphic novel of the same name. The story (and thus the songs) revolve around the relationship between divorcee Sue Bagnold and her fifteen-year-old son Daniel. Unexpectedly spending a pivotal summer together, Sue works as a librarian and Daniel is contrasted as a heavy metal-loving teen. Inspired by B&amp;S leader Stuart Murdoch&rsquo;s read of the novel, the soundtrack thankfully veers more towards the bibliophile than the head-banger. Two B&amp;S classics are re-worked, including a spritely updating of the perfect fitting <em>I Know Where The Summer Goes</em> as well as more of a straight read of <em>Get Me Away From Here I&rsquo;m Dying</em>. The songs range from topics of coming of age (the gentle <em>I&rsquo;ll Keep It Inside</em>) to coming to terms (the downcast <em>Did The Day Go Just </em><em>Like</em><em> You Wanted</em>). The best of the new tracks, <em>Sister Buddha</em>, is delivered in a hi-hat snare and piano-driven take as well as a crisply acoustic instrumental version to open the album. Both have a strong sentimental strain that share a melodic line with Guy Clark&rsquo;s <em>L.A. Freeway&mdash;</em>and they&#39;ll&nbsp;tug at the heartstrings. The tip-toed walk through the lounge-y bossa nova of <em>This Letter</em> harbors a pledge to move forward <em>&ldquo;although the world is fucked according to the news.&rdquo;</em> While the closing instrumental <em>We Were Never Glorious</em> is glorious in its hymn-like and regal use of piano and wordless harmonies; that is, except for the fact that it is marred mid-song with dialogue snippets from the movie. Thankfully, it&#39;s the only track on which that happens. At his most narrative, there is no doubt that <strong>Days Of The Bagnold Summer</strong> provided Murdoch with a much-needed muse to follow.<strong> [7/10]</strong> <em>Mark Moody</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Clairo.jpg" /><strong>Clairo</strong><br /><em>Immunity</em><br />(Fader Label)</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get the controversy out of the way, first: to give Claire Cottrill (aka Clairo) a hard time because of her connections with the music industry is besides the point (newsflash: half of the faux-disaffected indie artists you listen got their leg up through similar means). And frankly, I find the transparency refreshing. What I take into offense, though, if how the viral sensation&#39;s bland and hollow debut, <strong>Immunity</strong>, managed to get so much attention in the first place. Mind you, her hodgepodge of musical influences, from boom-bap and neo-soul to indie rock, showcase an artist who genuinely approaches the music she emulates like discovering an algorithmic Spotify playlist. And when she&#39;s on, she&#39;s really on: relatable heart-tuggers like <em>Bags</em> and <em>North</em> serve reverb-laden, uptempo anthems accompanied with sumptuous choruses (even if her voice sounds flatter than an iron board). But ultimately, Cottrill&#39;s clear songwriting focus gets bogged down with mellow, listless ballads that sound pleasant&mdash;and not much else.<strong> [5/10]</strong><em> Juan Edgardo Rodr√≠guez</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Futureheads.jpg" /><strong>The Futureheads</strong><br /><em>Powers</em><br />(Nul Records)</p>
<p>Rather than fake a breakup or try to capitalize on a niche audience, The Futureheads just disappeared. During almost the entirety of the 2010s, the Sunderland quartet had a genuine reason to go on hiatus&mdash;frontman Barry Hyde dealt with many facets of mental illness (fascinatingly documented on his spare, piano-driven 2016 solo album, <strong>Malody</strong>). But there was always a lingering suspicion that the post-punk harmonizers hadn&#39;t sung their last tune&mdash;and in <strong>Powers</strong>, their sixth album, they enter a new chapter conveying their typically joyous nature. The Futureheads were never ones to wind down, after all&mdash;on songs like <em>Jekyll</em> and <em>Electric Shock</em>, Hyde points to different traumatic periods, charged with a bristling fury that complements his lyrical growth. Guitarist Ross Millard is also a driving force on power-pop stompers like <em>Good Night Out </em>and <em>Stranger in a New Town</em>, his lower register increasingly maturing like a younger Paul Weller. And when not delving into personal matters, they dare to get political on <em>Across the Border</em>, an angry, spoken-word treatise that points the finger at those responsible for this Brexit mess. There&#39;s a lot to ponder while listening to <strong>Powers&#39;</strong> dynamic and exuberant contours, coming from a band that&#39;s adapting to life&#39;s changes with piercing directness. <strong>[8/10 - Believe the Hype] </strong><em>Juan Edgardo Rodr√≠guez</em><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Ty%20Segall.jpg" /><strong>Ty Segall</strong><br /><em>First Taste</em><br />(Drag City)</p>
<p>Though he comes across as a chill surfer dude, Ty Segall&#39;s output is anything but laid back. The multi-instrumentalist has participated in 86 recording projects, from collaborations to cassettes to live shows, spanning almost a dozen different bands. His studio albums, though, are the real gems of his career&mdash;the latest being <strong>First Taste</strong>, an album which will go down as one of Segall&#39;s more jubilant outings. The album opens with guitars like chainsaws, Segall&#39;s Valkyrie voice, and warbling sirens from outer-space. From there Segall explores kaleidoscopic avenues of folk, psychedelia, and rock, though each path shares a love for both good rhythms (one song layers a 6/8 over 4/4 beat with laser-beam guitars) and a playful nature. This latter quality is manifest by Renaissance Faire sounds like mandolins, wheezing horns, penny whistles, those wooden recorders from <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>, and an impetus to answer an unspoken call for &ldquo;More BONGOS!&rdquo; There&#39;s even something sounding like kazoo on Segall&#39;s requisite canine-themed song, <em>I Worship the Dog</em>. An overwhelming sense of fun pervades <strong>First Taste</strong>, as further epitomized in a couple of wacky drum solos that are so maniacal they&#39;ll bring a smile to your face. All in all, Ty Segall&#39;s obviously having fun as a result of being chiefly interested in entertaining himself. As he says on <em>I Sing Them:</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I&#39;m not wasting all my time singing other people&#39;s rhymes.. ...cause I&#39;d rather sound like me than try to sing your melody.&rdquo;</em> And amazingly, given his prolific output, he isn&#39;t wasting our time, either. <strong>[8/10] </strong><em>Kirk Sever</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Whitney.jpg" /><strong>Whitney</strong><br /><em>Forever Turned Around</em><br />(Secretly Canadian)</p>
<p>More of the same can often be a good thing. Just ask Whitney, whose new set of relaxed, carefree soft-rock should bode well for afternoon communal gatherings and rural, Summer music concert series&#39; alike. The Chicago octet&#39;s second LP, <strong>Forever Turned Around</strong>, is practically interchangeable from their debut <strong>Light Upon the Lake</strong>&mdash;and I suppose that&#39;s the point. Being chill is a lifestyle that they&#39;re capitalizing on, and they wouldn&#39;t dare to bring up any negative vibes into your day. See, there&#39;s nothing particularly grating about their gentle, country-pop stylings&mdash;most of which deal with themes such as nature, gratitude, and fleeting time. And these are all worthy topics to explore&mdash;except that every song sounds so gosh darn wholesome that it&#39;s as if they discourage against any deeper introspection. Whitney are soulful musicians who, even with their most leisurely, could genuinely inspire their audience&#39;s imagination; instead, they&#39;d rather want you to grab a cold one and go with the flow. <strong>[4/10] </strong>Juan Edgardo Rodr√≠guez</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user347/Pete%20Yorn.jpg" /><strong>Pete Yorn</strong><br /><em>Caretakers</em><br />(Shelly Music Company)</p>
<p>On <strong>Caretakers</strong>, Pete Yorn&#39;s winsome melodies sound so effortless that they&#39;re easy to take for granted. But it wasn&#39;t always like this&mdash;2016&#39;s <a href="../reviews/music/pete-yorn/arranging-time.html"><strong>Arranging Time</strong></a> brought an opportunity for the L.A. singer-songwriter to recapture his essence, a mellower, though more energetic response after an &quot;edgier&quot; partnership with Frank Black (<strong>Pete Yorn</strong>) and a stodgy recollection of his pop-rock debut that sunk in its soft-hued balladry (<strong>Back &amp; Fourth</strong>). Mind you, Yorn&#39;s seventh-album eddies like a calm, waveless beach&mdash;with Day Wave&#39;s Jackson Phillips by his side, he opts to add subtly glistening synth tones to his lovelorn acoustic strums. He&#39;s long laid to rest his heartland Americana explorations (even if he esteems Tom Petty on<em> I Wanna Be the One</em>), rather embracing the soft shimmer of adult-contemporary with his melancholic, minor-key reflections (<em>Ect</em>, <em>Idols</em>). Yorn loses some of the album&#39;s momentum as it progresses, too enamored with its stately flow&mdash;but just like any troubadour who calls L.A. home, he still writes some of the most tuneful folk-rock this side of Laurel Canyon. <strong>[7/10] </strong><em>Juan Edgardo Rodr√≠guez</em></p>
