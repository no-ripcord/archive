  <p>In spite of the usual lull of a new year, this January, in particular, was jam-packed with loads of exciting releases that cover a whole gamut of styles and attitudes. Sometimes we just don&#39;t have the time and resources to cover them all, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re always listening. Below are some records that just couldn&#39;t be left ignored.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user216/Bloc%20Party_0.jpg" />Bloc Party<br />Hymns<br />(Vagrant/BMG/Infectious)</p>
<p>Bloc Party are taking quite the commendable approach with their fifth full-length <strong>Hymns</strong>, one that intends to erase the much-beloved angst of their early albums in favor of a newfound spiritual ideology. This isn&rsquo;t to say that Bloc Party should go back to the exhilarating <strong>Silent Alarm</strong>. Artists should allow themselves for some necessary reinvention; the problem with <strong>Hymns</strong> is that it chugs along with a series of stilted niceties that lack any kind of rhythm or emotion. <em>The Love Within</em> and <em>Virtue</em> revisit the indie-disco hybrid of their past two records, trying to supplement an assortment of tired studio effects to compensate for the band&rsquo;s lack of chemistry. It&rsquo;s quite apparent that singer <span word="Kele" data-scaytid="4">Kele</span> <span word="Okereke" data-scaytid="7">Okereke</span> is trying to rid himself from past quarrel, so to see him embrace a more grounded and benevolent persona works to his personal betterment, though he should further consider if music is necessarily the more appropriate platform to express it. <strong>[4/10]</strong> <em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="8">Edgardo</span> <span word="Rodríguez" data-scaytid="9">Rodríguez</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user216/Charlie&#32;Hilton.jpg" />Charlie Hilton<br /><span word="Palana" data-scaytid="12">Palana</span><br />(Captured Tracks)</p>
<p>As part of dream pop outfit Blouse, Charlie Hilton crafted stiffly-danceable tunes that took a more cerebral form of electro-pop. Hilton wasn&rsquo;t the most striking vocalist, which suited the duo&rsquo;s hazy confections, though her first solo outing almost demands Hilton to step out of her shell to embody the French chanteuse that lives within her. Which shouldn&rsquo;t be that much of a challenge - throughout <strong><span word="Palana" data-scaytid="13">Palana</span></strong>, Hilton expertly forces that listless droll like some bored <span word="fashionista" data-scaytid="21">fashionista</span>, while other times she struggles to find a vocal compromise between Julia <span word="Holter" data-scaytid="22">Holter</span> and Trish Keenan. Hilton tries to be many things, oftentimes all at once, though sometimes it works: the jaunty new wave of <em>Pony</em> is relentlessly chirpy, while <em>Long Goodbye</em> is a <span word="spacey" data-scaytid="25">spacey</span>, <span word="reimagined" data-scaytid="26">reimagined</span> take on Brill-Building pop. All while trying to assume this brooding, lonely gaze, lost in a sonic fog even when the stars are surely aligned to her favor. <strong>[6/10] </strong><em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="27">Edgardo</span> <span word="Rodríguez" data-scaytid="28">Rodríguez</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user216/Chairlift.jpg" /><span word="Chairlift" data-scaytid="31">Chairlift</span><br />MOTH<br />(Columbia)</p>
<p><strong>MOTH</strong> is <span word="Chairlift’s" data-scaytid="32">Chairlift&rsquo;s</span> third LP, and it is their most confident sound to date. Caroline <span word="Polachek’s" data-scaytid="33">Polachek&rsquo;s</span> razor-sharp falsetto shines throughout, and is an open-ended contradiction to the gelatinous production work of Patrick <span word="Wimberly" data-scaytid="34">Wimberly</span>, giving the songs a mellow congeniality that allows the duo to seamlessly note their reflections in a self-assured manner. The album drops its anchor in the clearest of&nbsp;pop waters, but is able to easily make transitions from arty R&amp;B, funk-bass driven soul music and the sort of groove laden, <span word="80s-indebted" data-scaytid="37">80s-indebted</span> <span word="dancefloor" data-scaytid="40">dancefloor</span> bangers that ooze poise and probity. There is an alluring skewness to highlights such as <em><span word="Polymorphing" data-scaytid="41">Polymorphing</span></em> and <em>Show U Off</em>, whilst <em>Moth to the Flame</em> is a metaphor to the album itself: spilling how the irresistibility of something can ultimately be the thing that destroys you. All in all, the result of <span word="Chairlift" data-scaytid="42">Chairlift</span> dabbling in the mainstream pop archetype is the duo&rsquo;s best and most cohesive album to date. <strong>[8/10]</strong> <em>Carl <span word="Purvis" data-scaytid="46">Purvis</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user216/Conrad&#32;Keely.jpg" />Conrad <span word="Keely" data-scaytid="47">Keely</span><br />Original Machines<br />(<span word="Superball" data-scaytid="50">Superball</span> Music)</p>
<p>This one hurts. As the creative force behind &hellip;And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead, Conrad <span word="Keely" data-scaytid="16">Keely</span> has sculpted <span word="prog-rock" data-scaytid="17">prog-rock</span> fantasies and strident hardcore into elegant noise. It&rsquo;s the stubborn artiste in him that continues to find polarizing distinctions that shouldn&rsquo;t, in theory, quite mesh, so why not take the solo route and try to accomplish everything at once. As you&rsquo;d maybe expect, <strong>Original Machines</strong> is strictly fan-service; well, for the kind that doesn&rsquo;t mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF8L0MYoH4s"><em>Witch&rsquo;s Web</em></a> over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vsl35pTRMQ">Homage</a>, at least. It&rsquo;s an hour-long look into the CD format&rsquo;s past, when artists like <span word="Sebadoh" data-scaytid="18">Sebadoh</span> and Guided by Voices could cram in a plethora of short, hook-driven songs even when the sequencing was patchy. Except that Conrad&rsquo;s strategic intentions get the best of him, swerving between unmemorable mid-tempo cuts and stodgy piano playing with the occasional flashes of unfulfilled brilliance. <strong>[5/10]</strong> <em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="14">Edgardo</span> <span word="Rodríguez" data-scaytid="15">Rodríguez</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user216/Fat&#32;White&#32;Family.jpg" />Fat White Family<br />Songs for Our Mothers<br />(Fat Possum)</p>
<p>The Family&rsquo;s second LP was an opportunity to override their reputation for acting insane both on and off the stage with music. Their madness has undoubtedly been the keystone of their connection to their audience since their formation, but they don&rsquo;t just test the boundaries of what&rsquo;s tasteful and what&rsquo;s just downright offensive, they arrogantly stroll over it and spit in the face of anyone who has an issue with them doing so. <strong>Songs for Our Mothers</strong> isn&rsquo;t as musically disgusting as some of the themes covered suggest it should be. In some instances, the juxtaposition of horrific subject matter with calculated <span word="soundscapes" data-scaytid="59">soundscapes</span> is ominously unsettling, but for the most part just bores you to tears. It tethers itself loosely to a <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="62">lo-fi</span> rock template, with <span word="reverbed" data-scaytid="70">reverbed</span>, distorted guitars and a ghoulish vocal delivery, but there&rsquo;s an ecclesiastical overtone that makes it all the more disconcerting. From referencing Harold <span word="Shipman" data-scaytid="71">Shipman</span> in a song title to taking a moral high ground to the view of secluding yourself with drugs, <strong>Songs for Our Mothers</strong> presents an insignificant manifesto. <strong>[3/10]</strong> <em>Carl <span word="Purvis" data-scaytid="79">Purvis</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user216/MONEY.jpg" />MONEY<br />Suicide Songs<br />(Bella Union)</p>
<p>Manchester <span word="miserabilists" data-scaytid="81">miserabilists</span> MONEY sure know how to write a life-affirming song even when they&#39;re shrouded in dark dread. The lush strings belie the downtrodden nature of singer Jamie Lee, whose quivering yelp makes it all sound as if he&rsquo;s in the verge of some cathartic breakdown. But the multifaceted <strong>Suicide Songs</strong> manages to surprise and reward with some of their most accomplished work yet: from the lingering <span word="psychedelia" data-scaytid="82">psychedelia</span> of <em>Night Came</em> to the affecting crawl of <em>I&rsquo;ll Be the Night</em>, MONEY&rsquo;s overly-introspective musings are the perfect match for the song&rsquo;s atmospheric, though never bombastic anthems. <strong>Suicide Songs </strong>juggles anguish and optimism in equal measure, somehow mournful and triumphant in search for some kind of personal salvation. Their <span word="Mancunian" data-scaytid="85">Mancunian</span> progenitors Elbow would be proud. <strong>[8/10]</strong> <em>Juan Edgardo Rodríguez</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user216/Mystery%20Jets.jpg" />Mystery Jets<br />Curve of the Earth<br />(Caroline International)<br />&nbsp;<br />Even ten years after their debut, it&rsquo;s hard to think about Mystery Jets without thinking about their sketchy portraits of young love. Their hazy, amiable delivery and tangled guitars allowed them to stand out from a plethora of rank average British indie bands that were sharpening their chops at the same time, but now they&rsquo;re a completely different band. <strong>Curve of the Earth</strong> takes on a more progressive stance than we&rsquo;ve seen from the band in the past, channeling the <span word="prog" data-scaytid="90">prog</span> of King Crimson and <span word="Syd" data-scaytid="91">Syd</span> Barrett-era Pink Floyd into a distinct but still relatively accessible sound. The only trouble is that it&rsquo;s very difficult to stay engaged with the album. Its progression is too deliberate, as if every convoluted idea the band had in the writing process was crammed in just to avoid it going unheard. There are some very good moments &ndash; <em>Taken By The Tide</em> is brilliantly structured, whilst <em>Bombay Blue</em> is anchored by a solid groove and a handsome vocal. All in all, <strong>Curve of the Earth</strong> comes across a little on the self-indulgent side, and although most bands evolve and move on from past successes, over-complicating things can lead to that band losing their sense of character and identity. <strong>[5/10] </strong><em>Carl <span word="Purvis" data-scaytid="94">Purvis</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user216/Pop.&#32;1280.jpg" />Pop. 1280<br />Paradise<br />(Sacred Bones)</p>
<p>Pop. 1280 were once unruly misanthropes with an appetite for scathing pandemonium, though throughout the years they&rsquo;ve incorporated subtle hints of punctuated <span word="synth" data-scaytid="96">synth</span> noise to their oftentimes in-the-red interplay. There&rsquo;s a lot to absorb within their uncompromisingly hostile behavior, since their rackety, almost makeshift production goes straight for the guttural. <strong>Paradise</strong> is the closest they&rsquo;ve come to separating themselves from sludgy noise rock, opting almost exclusively for an industrial-sounding squall that further fleshes their droning atonal passages. It&rsquo;s as if they decided to ditch the use of guitars altogether, utilizing sooty, piercing <span word="synths" data-scaytid="97">synths</span> more prominently into songs that veer into thick, cathartic <span word="goth" data-scaytid="100">goth</span> (<em><span word="Chromedia" data-scaytid="101">Chromedia</span></em>) or synthetic <span word="EBM" data-scaytid="102">EBM</span> (<em>Rain Song</em>). Pop. 1280 are still concerned with the dark underbelly of the human experience, though the sneakily measured <strong>Paradise</strong> proves that even the most degenerate souls deserve some sanguine aggression, too. <strong>[7/10]<em> </em></strong><em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="103">Edgardo</span> <span word="Rodríguez" data-scaytid="104">Rodríguez</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="https://www.noripcord.com/files/user216/Sia.jpg" /><span word="Sia" data-scaytid="107">Sia</span><br />This Is Acting<br />(RCA)<br />&nbsp;<br />By <span word="Sia" data-scaytid="108">Sia</span> <span word="Furler’s" data-scaytid="109">Furler&rsquo;s</span> own admission, <strong>This Is Acting</strong> is an array of songs written for other artists that just didn&rsquo;t quite cut the mustard for their intended targets. As a result, it&rsquo;s an album that is a reconstruction of something that never existed as a single entity in the first place. The songs are pop gold, showcasing <span word="Sia’s" data-scaytid="110">Sia&rsquo;s</span> gigantic voice and songwriting prowess, and would probably all win <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="113">Eurovision</span> with a succession of <span word="‘douze" data-scaytid="114">&lsquo;douze</span> points.&rsquo; The songs do undoubtedly miss a personal aspect, and in that sense the finished product&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t always&nbsp;feel like an album, but these songs were never supposed to be personal. In fact, listening to <strong>This Is Acting</strong> is more like listening to a compilation album. Either way, it&rsquo;s a fascinating insight into how pop music is written, and how very few writers are responsible for the swathes of it in the charts. Whilst listening to it, you can actually hazard pretty good guesses as to who each song was originally written for. Every track is a potential hit, and <span word="Sia’s" data-scaytid="115">Sia&rsquo;s</span> use of pure pop hooks, coupled with an astounding control over her rampant voice, makes this a very good record.&nbsp;<strong>[7/10] </strong><em>Carl <span word="Purvis" data-scaytid="119">Purvis</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user216/rsz_tricky.jpg" />Tricky<br />Tricky Presents Skilled Mechanics<br />(False Idols)</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Mechanics</strong> is the new project of Tricky, and it is one that sees him adopt a more synergetic way of producing a record. Along with DJ Milo and Luke Harris, Adrian Thaws has put together a record of perfectly executed, <span word="baroscopic" data-scaytid="121">baroscopic</span> beats, and the result is that we just may have a Tricky record that can be talked about in the same breath as his 21-year-old debut. The mood smolders from start to finish, and with only two of the album&rsquo;s thirteen tracks running for more than three minutes, each track is sharp and incisive. With any Tricky record, guest vocalists are going to be commonplace, and his <span word="nous" data-scaytid="124">nous</span> for finding the most suitable voice for his precise mindset is hugely evident. The vocals on opening track <em>I&rsquo;m Not Going</em> come from Danish singer Oh Land, and the embers peel from her voice to intensify intoxicating fumes. Chinese rapper Ivy brings a stinging attitude to warping track <em>Beijing to Berlin</em>, and Francesca <span word="Belamonte’s" data-scaytid="127">Belamonte&rsquo;s</span> exposed, cutting tones make full use of the album&rsquo;s shortest track, <em>We Begin</em>. <strong>Skilled Mechanics</strong> is an intelligent, pertinent piece of work that shows just how fresh the ideas of Thaws remain. [8/10] Carl <span word="Purvis" data-scaytid="128">Purvis</span><br />&nbsp;</p>
