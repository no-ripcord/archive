  <p>Welcome to this slightly abridged version of Quick Takes! It&#39;s just me this time, as Carl is still on a hiatus, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;d like to let all of you know that he&#39;s really into the new Internet record. As for me, my two top picks this month come from promising trio The Ophelias and fellow Puerto Rican folktronica group Balún. I was also quite delighted to hear that The Rock*A*Teens are back, a superb indie rock band from the early 2000&#39;s who deserve to be more than a well-kept secret.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What were your favorite albums during the month of July? Anything we didn&#39;t get to review on our site that we should&#39;ve? You can always reach us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noripcordmagazine">Facebook</a>, or on our official <a href="https://www.twitter.com/noripcord">twitter</a> page. Juan</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user339/Balun.jpg" /><strong>Balún</strong><br /><em>Prisma Tropical</em><br />(Good Child Music)</p>
<p>Balún escape into an idyllic tropical getaway on <strong>Prisma Tropical</strong>. Since their start, the Brooklyn-via-Puerto Rico quartet have focused their attention on the dreamier side of electronic music alongside acoustic and chamber instrumentation, but this time around, they&#39;re expanding their influences even further. Inspired by the dembow movement - a sound that is practically ubiquitous to their native homeland - the husband-and-wife duo of José Olivares and Angelica Negrón, both adroit musos who come from academic musical backgrounds, entangle those distinct elements into a congenial atmosphere filled with bewildering masses of color. Much of <strong>Prisma Tropical</strong> invites you to dance to their ambling rhythms, like in <em>La Nueva Ciudad</em>, but there&#39;s also a tenuous melancholy that surrounds its otherwise ambient passages. It&#39;s a generous hour-long offering that seldom repeats itself, and the band makes sure to pull all the stops as if it were their last chance to make a final impression. Which hopefully isn&#39;t the case, because as the enlightening <strong>Prisma Tropical</strong> attests, their radiant, untroubled look into Latino displacement and identity within a dominant Anglo-Saxon musical landscape should, in an ideal world, leap over those barriers. <strong>[8/10]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user339/The%20Ophelias.jpg" /><strong>The Ophelias</strong><br /><em>Almost</em><br />(Joyful Noise)</p>
<p>The Ophelias were fortunate to have met through similarly distasteful circumstances. After parting ways with their respective male-oriented bands, the Cincinnati, Ohio quartet wanted to write songs which addressed their concerns as young women. And<em> Almost</em>, their second effort, strengthens that point of view by pairing up stories of sorrow and gallows humor with a delicate constitution. Underscored with a minimal production by musician Yoni Wolf, the band carry their chamber pop arrangements with a lo-fi grain that sounds like it was recorded inside a dusty basement. Under the guise of an amateur, that cavernous ambiance would&#39;ve obfuscated their luscious instrumentation. But the tinny, almost stifling recording adds a unique and personal touch that further emphasizes their songwriting idiosyncrasies. But above else, <strong>Almost</strong> presents touching, and often forthright, chronicles of the messy scenarios we stumble into which defy easy explanations. <strong>[8/10]</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user339/Rock%20a%20Teens.jpg" /><strong>The Rock*A*Teens</strong><br /><em>Sixth House</em><br />(Merge)</p>
<p>Not too many bands can approach the grandiose as faultlessly as The Rock*A*Teens. That&#39;s not to say that it was the chief characteristic of the Cabbagetown, Georgia&#39;s sound, but there is a life-affirming zest to their songs that lights up the sky like fireworks. It&#39;s been eighteen years since the cult band released their last record, the masterful <strong>Sweet Bird Youth</strong>, a quiet departure that felt unfair considering they influenced artists like Okkervil River and The New Pornographers (and though not stated publicly, I&#39;m sure the bookish musicologists of Arcade Fire stole a thing or two from them). What&#39;s fascinating about their return in album form, <strong>Sixth </strong><strong>House</strong>, is how they manage to pick themselves quite faithfully from their teetering anthemic force. Age and wisdom do punctuate their dramatic delivery even further, though instead of a celebration, there&#39;s a palpable darkness that seeps into those positively transcendent moments. The quartet always sounded bigger than themselves, and not much has changed in this respect, from the bittersweet fable <em>Count in Odd Numbers</em> to the descending, sunburned blues of <em>Lady Macbeth</em>. The Rock*A*Teens never got their due, and though <strong>Sixth House</strong> will remain a well-kept secret, it should at least redeem a band who&#39;s long overdue a reappraisal.<strong> [7/10]</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user339/Trust%20Fund.jpg" /><strong>Trust Fund</strong><br /><em>Bringing the Backline</em><br />(Ellis N Jones)</p>
<p>Ellis Jones is starting to burn out on <strong>Bringing the Backline</strong>. For five years, the Bristol singer-songwriter known as Trust Fund, alongside a revolving cast of musicians, has maintained a prolific streak of records which are filled with striking and amusing remarks. Even if his albums are usually adorned with a playful mesh of divergent musical styles - filled with self-referential experiences told from an anti-rock star stance - he essentially interlocks them within fierce power-pop anthems. And <strong>Bringing the Backline</strong> continues his knack for razor-sharp, yet sugary guitars, a driving force which counters against his timid, squeamish vocal delivery. But that&#39;s also Jones&#39;s quiet strength; his scuffed-up, handclap worthy sing-alongs wouldn&#39;t resonate as well if he performed them with a disingenuous confidence. As it is with an artist whose chock-full of ideas, <strong>Bringing the Backline</strong> does suffer from throwing in too many ideas at once, prickly indulgences which cast a shadow to his otherwise simple, yet sturdy compositions. But being his last album as Trust Fund, there&#39;s a sense that he was intent on giving it the ornate conclusion it deserves. It&#39;s a shame he threw in the towel just as we were getting to know him. <strong>[7/10]</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="" height="150" hspace="5" img="" src="../files/user339/Wet.jpg" /><strong>Wet</strong><br /><em>Still</em><em> Run</em><br />(Colombia)</p>
<p>Brooklyn duo Wet fight off the remnants of a dwindling ethereal R&amp;B era on <strong>Still Run</strong>. Not that there&#39;s the possibility of making it sound compelling again, but as the commonplace ten tracks on this album show, it sounds like they&#39;re content with competing against the dime-o-dozen artists who are trying to get a fair shot from clueless music executives. Some of <strong>Still Run</strong> sounds promising, even if the trite sentimentality that accompanies it doesn&#39;t do it any favors - Kelly Zutrau impersonates the rugged charm of Amy Winehouse with satisfactory results on <em>You&#39;re Not Wrong</em>, while the ghostly lullaby of <em>Love is Not Enough</em> is a sweet sendoff that frustratingly pinpoints what the album could&#39;ve been with a change of focus. Wet feel disconnected from the album&#39;s overarching theme, and though they do put some feeling into their maudlin ballads, you&#39;ll come off it without remembering a single note. <strong>[3/10]&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>
