  <p>Hey there, pop-pickers!</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s currently recovering from <span word="Bestival" data-scaytid="1">Bestival</span> (expect the fruits of his and Craig&rsquo;s coverage later in the week), meaning that once again you have me filling in, and once again I&rsquo;m suffering from a major case of sporting withdrawal and in no real mood to write about music. I&rsquo;ve spent the past month and a half admiring the dedication, not to mention the magnificent physiques, of the athletes and I&rsquo;m just not quite ready to turn my attention back to those swathes of fey young things in vintage shirts and skinny jeans going on about how unfair/lovely everything is, or to those uninspired videos that consist solely of unhealthy amounts of close-ups on girls&rsquo; bikini-clad backsides.</p>
<p>I did consider using this week&rsquo;s column to comment on the music choices at the Games (Orbital&rsquo;s take on <em><span word="Spasticus" data-scaytid="2">Spasticus</span> <span word="Artisticus" data-scaytid="3">Artisticus</span></em> &ndash; genius or a bit too blunt? How about <em>My Girls</em> playing during the blind and partially sighted women&rsquo;s <span word="400m" data-scaytid="4">400m</span> finals - awesome or slightly <span word="patronising" data-scaytid="5">patronising</span>?), but eventually I had to admit to myself that there&rsquo;s not much justification for me to do so as there&rsquo;s (thankfully) nothing as spectacularly misjudged as that George Michael closing ceremony plug to deal with this week &ndash; say what you like about Coldplay, Rihanna or Jay-Z, but all of them have considerably more class than that.</p>
<p>So, enough about the sport, I suppose. Bring on the singles!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Kodaline" data-scaytid="6">Kodaline</span> &ndash; The <span word="Kodaline" data-scaytid="7">Kodaline</span> EP</strong></p>
<p>Now this is exactly what I was talking about; you can practically picture the fashionably unfashionable cardigans on hearing the falsetto and sensitively strummed guitars in <em>All I Want</em>, the lead track of Irish band <span word="Kodaline’s" data-scaytid="9">Kodaline&rsquo;s</span> self-titled EP. Add to that a sensitive yet inconsequential narrative video and a universally vague sentiment - that everybody just needs to be loved &ndash; and it&rsquo;s enough evidence to confirm that <span word="Kodaline" data-scaytid="8">Kodaline</span> can be filed snugly alongside Coldplay. Nobody could deny it&rsquo;s all very slickly produced or that the song&rsquo;s soaring climax is affectingly effective, but I expect that few of us could come up with a decent argument for its reason to exist either. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The <span word="Maginot" data-scaytid="11">Maginot</span> Band &ndash; Slow Down Sundial</strong></p>
<p>The <span word="Maginot" data-scaytid="12">Maginot</span> Band have been around for a while, initially going by the name Maydays, and gathering some support by opening for the likes of Field Music. <em>Slow Down Sundial</em> though is in fact their debut release, and it sees them make a rather promising start. Admittedly there is something of the <span word="Gallaghers" data-scaytid="14">Gallaghers</span> in the carefree belted out vocals (just with a bit of a Scottish accent), which isn&rsquo;t entirely to my taste, but there&rsquo;s still a lot here that took my fancy, such as the laid-back sunniness of the production and their downright luscious guitar sound.<strong> 7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tame Impala &ndash; Elephant</strong></p>
<p>Odds are you&rsquo;ve already heard Elephant by now, as it&rsquo;s been making the rounds of the music blogging community over the past couple of months. If not, it&rsquo;s a rousingly <span word="bluesy" data-scaytid="15">bluesy</span> stomp, and a definite throwback to late <span word="60s" data-scaytid="16">60s</span> <span word="psychedelia" data-scaytid="17">psychedelia</span>. Think <em>Come Together</em> with a <span word="Moog" data-scaytid="18">Moog</span> solo and you&rsquo;re pretty much there. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plan B &ndash; Deepest Shame</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever get the feeling that you&rsquo;re the sole voice of reason in a world gone mad? For me, the output of Ben Drew does just that &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not just down to the mega success of the incredibly cynical ...<strong>Strickland Banks</strong> album; even people whose opinions I very much admire have argued that his debut was &lsquo;gritty&rsquo; and &lsquo;vital&rsquo; or that <a href="singles-bar-26th-march-2012.html"><span word="iLL" data-scaytid="71">i<em>LL</em></span><em> Manors</em> could be &quot;one of the most important and thrilling singles in UK chart history</a>&quot; (I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re never going to live that one down, Joe). I&rsquo;m sorry, but I still can&rsquo;t get on board. Of course the man has talent, but his approach is far too witless to be effective.</p>
<p><em>Deepest Shame</em> is the latest single to be taken from the admittedly alright soundtrack to the truly awful<strong>&nbsp;<span word="iLL" data-scaytid="78">iLL</span> Manors</strong>, and is only really notable for marrying his soul crooner and rapper personas, so will probably be warmly received by a sizeable portion of his <span word="fanbase" data-scaytid="19">fanbase</span>. As for me&hellip; well, I didn&rsquo;t find it offensive as such, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good thing. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Owl City &amp; Carly Rae Jepson &ndash; Good Time</strong></p>
<p><a href="../reviews/music/owl-city/all-things-bright-and-beautiful.html">Adam Young has come in for a bit of a kicking around these parts</a>, and quite rightly too &ndash; the fact that he&rsquo;s not only based his entire career on ripping off the Postal Service, but replacing their melancholic wit with wishy-washy (and essentially meaningless) platitudes. On the other hand, I have nothing against Carly Rae Jepson &ndash; yes, we&rsquo;re probably all a bit sick of <em>Call Me Maybe</em> now, but it&#39;s held up to repeated <span word="listenings" data-scaytid="80">listenings</span> far better than most songs, so I still went into this collaboration with a degree of optimism.</p>
<p>Turns out I shouldn&rsquo;t have bothered though, as <em>Good Time</em> is unfortunately far more the work of the former than the latter; Jepson may dominate the chorus, the majority of it though practically drips in Young&rsquo;s signature wetness. The Euro-pop <span word="synths" data-scaytid="21">synths</span> may be catchy, in an annoying sort of way, but it&rsquo;s so screamingly innocuous (Exhibit A: Young blandly trilling the lines &ldquo;Woke up on the right side of the bed / what&rsquo;s up with this Prince song inside my head?&rdquo;) and such a blatant attempt at squeaky clean fun that one suspects it&rsquo;ll be gleefully adopted as the soundtrack of teen abstinence rallies across the western world, which is not the basis of decent pop music. In short, it makes <span word="Kodaline" data-scaytid="20">Kodaline</span> look like fucking Shaft.<strong> 2/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Tulisa" data-scaytid="23">Tulisa</span> Featuring&nbsp;<span word="Tyga" data-scaytid="24">Tyga</span> &ndash; Live It Up</strong></p>
<p>Although she really doesn&rsquo;t need my sympathy, what with her glittering career and enviable youth, I do feel for <span word="Tulisa" data-scaytid="25">Tulisa</span>. Not only has she had to spend years putting up with and excusing the idiocy of bobble-hatted cock <span word="Dappy" data-scaytid="27">Dappy</span> (*spits*) but now she&rsquo;s part of the Simon <span word="Cowell" data-scaytid="28">Cowell</span> juggernaut, forced to spend her weekends sat next to Louis Walsh and crushing the dreams of the young and innocent (and, it must be said, borderline mentally ill).</p>
<p>I must say that I feel somewhat less warmly towards her after having to listen to <em>Live It Up</em> though. For a start the fact that it&rsquo;s a summer song that&rsquo;s been inexplicably released in the Autumn is somehow the least of its problems. As for what the most offensive part about it is, well, it&rsquo;s difficult to say - the dancehall-aping siren-based riff is unpleasant; <span word="Tulisa’s" data-scaytid="29">Tulisa&rsquo;s</span> <span word="lairy" data-scaytid="30">lairy</span> and tuneless vocals are unspeakably irritating and <span word="Tyga’s" data-scaytid="31">Tyga&rsquo;s</span> input is so lazy it&rsquo;s barely there. To put it bluntly, it&rsquo;s positively ghastly. How ghastly you may be (but probably aren&#39;t) asking? Ghastly enough that the video&rsquo;s similarity to that of Paris Hilton&rsquo;s <em>Stars Are Blind</em> made me <span word="realise" data-scaytid="32">realise</span> that I&rsquo;d much rather be listening to that instead. <strong>0/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Society &ndash; All That We&rsquo;ve Become</strong></p>
<p>As with The <span word="Maginot" data-scaytid="33">Maginot</span> Band, there&rsquo;s a bit of a musical and vocal disconnect in <em>All That We&rsquo;ve Become</em>. There&rsquo;s a definite (and mostly successful) striving towards the lush orchestrations of The Walker Brothers, yet the vocals come across a bit too Richard <span word="Ashcroft" data-scaytid="35">Ashcroft</span> for comfort. It&rsquo;s still slickly done, and rather lovely though. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Old Apparatus &ndash; <span word="Realise" data-scaytid="36">Realise</span> EP</strong></p>
<p>Never has there been a more appropriately named band (if they are, in fact, a band &ndash; just about the only description I&rsquo;ve found of Old Apparatus calls them a &lsquo;shadowy <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="38">post-dubstep</span> collective&rsquo;) as<em> <span word="Realise" data-scaytid="37">Realise</span></em> sounds like the clicking and ticking of broken down electronics, in a rather romantic way. The only problem is that, while trying so hard to be tastefully attractive, it ends up a bit too dry and wispy to make much of an impression. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lorn &ndash; Weigh Me Down</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t write about electronic music as it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to not show my age when attempting to pick through the various genres and sub-genres, not to mention the seemingly endless faceless, and often ridiculously <span word="monikered" data-scaytid="40">monikered</span>, producers (it&rsquo;s a slippery slope from here to grumbling at passing kids that music was better in my day). While I could attempt to classify <em>Weigh Me Down</em> (I think it would also qualify as <span word="‘post-dubstep’" data-scaytid="41">&lsquo;post-dubstep&rsquo;</span>) or do a cursory bit of background research on Lorn so as not to come across as a complete ignoramus, I&rsquo;d probably be better off just spending the time and word-count on describing what it actually sounds like, which is tricky enough in itself as there&rsquo;s plenty going on here &ndash; <span word="doomy" data-scaytid="42">doomy</span>, even disturbingly filthy, vocals, movie soundtrack strings, clattering beats (it certainly packs the punch that Old Apparatus were missing) and what may be a hammered dulcimer - all in the space of less than four minutes. It requires a lot of effort to take it all in, and is absolutely worth it. <strong>8/10 Single Of The Week</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers &ndash; Magpies On Fire/Victorian Machinery</strong></p>
<p>The second in the Peppers&rsquo; series of double-A sided singles and somehow it&rsquo;s so much worse than the first. Even hardcore <span word="Chilis" data-scaytid="43">Chilis</span> fans (such people must exist, surely? Not that I&rsquo;ve ever met any) will struggle to find much of interest, or even a discernible tune, in <em>Victorian Machinery</em> (and while <em>Magpies On Fire</em> might be a marginally less unpleasant listen, that&rsquo;s still a long way off being a recommendation). <strong>Please Stop/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s <span word="yer" data-scaytid="44">yer</span> lot. Joe should be back next week, in the meantime I&rsquo;m off to see someone at <span word="LOCOG" data-scaytid="45">LOCOG</span> to present my ideas for extending the franchise. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll agree that a <span word="Doglympics" data-scaytid="46">Doglympics</span> would prove wildly popular.<br />&nbsp;</p>
