  <p class="p1">Season&#39;s greetings!</p>
<p class="p1">That&#39;s probably enough festive cheer for now - best save some for the glut of Christmas songs at the end of this week&#39;s column. Joe&#39;s still putting the list of the year together so he&#39;s currently buried in statistics and spreadsheets (the only word he&#39;s sent so far is that somehow <strong>Lulu</strong> hasn&#39;t been crowned album of the year), although I do wonder if it was merely a ploy to avoid having to review this year&#39;s X Factor winner&#39;s single.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Little Mix - Cannonball</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Not that there&#39;s really much to review. The X Factor is almost entirely incompatible with the notion of music criticism as any releases related to the show exist more as a souvenir of the TV show than as actual music. Just about all I can manage to say about this year&#39;s winner&#39;s song is that it&#39;s positively stuffed with saccharine, treacle-thick harmonies and going by this evidence I&#39;d be surprised if the girls will still be around by this time next year, despite them being styled as the next Girls Aloud.&nbsp; But, to be fair to them, Damien Rice&#39;s acoustic sensitivity/dirge was a poor choice of song in the first place, fingers crossed that the second single is a more appropriate one.&nbsp;<strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span word="Cee-Lo" data-scaytid="1">Cee-Lo</span> Green - Anyway</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Anyway</em> will come as a delight to <span word="Cee-Lo" data-scaytid="2">Cee-Lo</span> fans, as it&#39;s ever so slightly rubbish, which means that it&#39;s another compelling reason to not buy the cynical &quot;deluxe&quot; edition of <strong>The Lady Killer</strong> that it was taken from. Technically, the song itself has its moments (although I liked it better when it was Kylie&#39;s <em>I Believe In You</em>), but it&#39;s very strange that <span word="Cee-Lo" data-scaytid="3">Cee-Lo</span> seems to have been <span word="autotuned" data-scaytid="5">autotuned</span> on it: if there was ever an artist who didn&#39;t need to use the technology, it&#39;s him.&nbsp;<strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Coldplay - Charlie Brown</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I&#39;m not sure what we did to deserve two Coldplay singles in as many weeks (or what I did to have to review them). Fortunately <em>Charlie Brown</em> is much better than last week&#39;s offering, and ironically actually a much better Christmas single thanks to the rousing melancholia that has become Coldplay&#39;s stock in trade actually having a sort of <span word="carol-esque" data-scaytid="6">carol-esque</span> to it. Actually the song&#39;s even quite adventurous (by their standards), featuring an intro that manages to reference both Happy Hardcore and Wild Beasts. Shame that it then succumbs to the not-quite-definable dourness that marks most of Coldplay&#39;s output (at least since the second album).&nbsp;<strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Naked &amp; Famous - No Way</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Somehow No Way manages to tread a very thin line between boredom and exhilaration. The first verse is only marginally more interesting than Coldplay&#39;s effort, but about a minute in the song reveals its jagged heart (although not its &#39;heart&#39; - the closest that the song comes to actual warmth only occurs in the dying moments). For the most part it&#39;s stylish, elegant, and, in its waves of pulsing electronics, very cool, but there&#39;s also the niggling feeling that it&#39;s not particularly nourishing in the long run.&nbsp;<strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Frank Turner - Wessex Boy</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Frank Turner has been getting a lot of love from the music press over the past year, and I&#39;m at a loss to explain why. <em>Wessex Boy</em>&#39;s faux-folk whimsy, awkwardly scanning lyrics and misplaced passionate yelling would all be fine if performed by a guy in the corner of the local pub, but how he&#39;s managed to make the leap from that to a devoted fan-base and critical plaudits is anyone&#39;s guess.&nbsp;<strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Steel Panther - Just Like Tiger Woods</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I&#39;m almost certain that nobody asked Santa for a new The Darkness, and yet we&#39;ve somehow got one anyway. Intentionally comedic music is a hard thing to get right and, going by this evidence, Steel Panther have absolutely no hope, they can&#39;t even get any laughs out of the easy target of Tiger Woods. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">And if spoof hair metal&#39;s not your thing, this week also offers equally terrible spoof funk in the form of Doctor P&#39;s <em><span word="Superbad" data-scaytid="7">Superbad</span></em>, and <span word="wonky" data-scaytid="8">wonky</span> <span word="chillwave" data-scaytid="9">chillwave</span> in Caged Animals&#39; <em>Piles of $$$</em> which sounds like a joke even if it probably isn&#39;t.&nbsp;<strong>0/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Rapture - Sail Away EP</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Rapture have gone up and down in our collective estimations more times than I can keep track of, though I expect <em>Sail Away</em> will send them all the way back down again. Their rhythm section&#39;s as tight as ever but the vocals&#39; uneasy mix of equal parts Harry <span word="Belafonte" data-scaytid="10">Belafonte</span> and Mika adds up to little more than a cacophony of irritations. <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Phenomenal <span word="Handclap" data-scaytid="11">Handclap</span> Band - Unknown Faces At Father James Park</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Unknown Faces At Father James Park</em> is an spectacularly weird song, although fortunately not in the forced, slightly <span word="twee" data-scaytid="12">twee</span> way that the name suggests. Rather it&#39;s an aggressively strange jumble of 60&#39;s girl group pop and psychedelic rock (music which was strange enough to start with) with a chorus that sounds just like a cheerful version of <span word="Warpaint" data-scaytid="13">Warpaint</span>. It&#39;s both unseasonably sunny and delightfully curious.<strong> 8/10 - SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Drake Featuring <span word="Nicki" data-scaytid="14">Nicki</span> <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="15">Minaj</span> - Make Me Proud</strong></p>
<p class="p1">As with Frank Turner I still don&#39;t quite get the love that Drake&#39;s been getting this year, although in his case I&#39;m putting it down to the fact that it&#39;s &#39;an American thing&#39;. Anyway, this is much better than his last single, even if it does seem a bit <span word="lke" data-scaytid="16">lke</span> it&#39;s deliberately trying to irritate with Drake&#39;s <span word="motormouth" data-scaytid="17">motormouth</span> flow. Somehow he&#39;s hit on a previously unknown middle-ground between <strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong> (an easy comparison to make due to <span word="Nicki" data-scaytid="18">Nicki</span> <span word="Minaj&#039;s" data-scaytid="20">Minaj&#39;s</span> guest vocals) and <span word="Zomby&#039;s" data-scaytid="21">Zomby&#39;s</span> <strong>Dedication</strong>. It&#39;s debatable as to whether the end results are actually pleasant, but unlike <em>Headlines</em>, at least they&#39;re sort-of interesting. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Mick <span word="Hucknall" data-scaytid="22">Hucknall</span> - Happy This Christmas; George Michael - December Song; Gruff Rhys - Atheist Xmas EP; The <span word="Wombles" data-scaytid="23">Wombles</span> - A <span word="Wombling" data-scaytid="24">Wombling</span> Merry Christmas</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I could, but won&#39;t, use this review as an opportunity to go into one of those &quot;how come nobody does proper Christmas songs anymore&quot; rants as it&#39;s less than two weeks until the big day and all we&#39;ve been given is two re-releases, one rather <span word="unfestively" data-scaytid="27">unfestively</span> minded EP and Mick <span word="Hucknall" data-scaytid="25">Hucknall</span>. Although to be fair to <span word="Hucknall" data-scaytid="26">Hucknall</span> he does go the whole hog and get the sleigh bells out, not that it&#39;s enough to enliven such a leaden song though.<strong> 2/10&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Michael&#39;s festive effort is thankfully much better, being almost endearing in its self-conscious smallness and how it seems to be about how he just wants to sit down and watch the telly. What&#39;s less endearing is that he&#39;s released it for three years on the trot now, as if to try and create a new Christmas tradition, which is honestly never going to happen. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p class="p1">People who proudly announce themselves as Atheists are second on my list of annoyances to those who go on about how they don&#39;t watch TV. Both groups may have a point, but their tendency to proclaim it even when unprompted makes me want to ignore them in <span word="favour" data-scaytid="30">favour</span> of those Evangelical channels you find buried in the upper reaches of the cable channel guide. On the other hand Gruff Rhys is a general all-round top bloke who I can never bring myself to dislike even when I don&#39;t care much for his music, so I suppose that there was the potential that the <strong>Atheist Xmas EP</strong> would make question at least one of my beliefs. Listening to it though reveals that it&#39;s pretty much business as usual; Rhys isn&#39;t really trying to do a Dawkins, instead he&#39;s just written some amusingly cynical songs with a loose seasonal theme (the best of which is the last track, <em>Slashed Wrists This Christmas</em>) and accompanied them with more bright but inessential, and slightly atonal, melodies. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Finally, I was going to write that it&#39;s at least nice to end the review on a proven classic, but in truth I think the version of <em>A <span word="Wombling" data-scaytid="31">Wombling</span> Merry Christmas</em> that exists in my childhood memories is actually much better than the real thing. Much like the holiday itself. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p class="p2">. . .</p>
<p class="p1">And on that downer, that&#39;s it for this week. Merry Christmas.</p>
