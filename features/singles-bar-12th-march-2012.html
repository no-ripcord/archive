  <p>News reaches us here that, in the UK, <em>Somebody That I Used To Know</em> by <span word="Gotye" data-scaytid="1">Gotye</span> has become the first track to shift 500,000 copies in the year of 2012. If that doesn&rsquo;t hasten the need for new, fresh, exciting music to descend on the singles charts, I don&rsquo;t know what does. Luckily, there are a smorgasbord of tracks ready for you below, so pull up a chair and tuck in.</p>
<p><strong>M.I.A. &ndash; Bad Girls</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for M.I.A. She&rsquo;s on the verge of mainstream success but to achieve it, she risks losing what made her distinctive in the first place. In fact, I&rsquo;m about to stake claim to the headline, &ldquo;How do you solve a problem like M.I.A.?&rdquo; so you need to talk to me first if you want to write that article. You get the feeling there will be <span word="mis-steps" data-scaytid="2">mis-steps</span> along the way but on <em>Bad Girls</em>, M.I.A. judges things perfectly. She manages to combine catchy rhymes with a commercial sensibility, hip-hop beats and the kind of Middle Eastern hook that 99% of pop stars wouldn&rsquo;t go near. It&rsquo;s done with aplomb, and while it lacks the punch of some of her earlier work, it could well be the catalyst to full crossover commercial success. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexandra &nbsp;Burke &ndash; Elephant feat. Erick <span word="Morillo" data-scaytid="4">Morillo</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Alexandra Burke won X Factor due to her ballad-friendly voice but, cover of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s <em>Hallelujah </em>aside, she&rsquo;s concentrated primarily on club-friendly R&amp;B instead since that victory. That powerful voice which caused so many to pick up the phone back in 2008 has been stripped of all semblance of character and auto-tuned to death on <em>Elephant</em>, with the consequence that this track could be by pretty much anyone. It&rsquo;s yet more chart-friendly faceless Ibiza-influenced pop and, even for that most unlovable of genres, this is a poor and forgettable effort. Also, while this elephant in question may be the <em>&ldquo;elephant in the room&rdquo;</em> of a failing relationship, we&rsquo;ve certainly learned that &lsquo;elephant&rsquo; is not a word that goes particularly well with huge dance anthems. <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p><strong><span word="Katzenjammer" data-scaytid="6">Katzenjammer</span> &ndash; I Will Dance (When I Walk Away)</strong></p>
<p>As well as being the surname of <span word="Tamsin" data-scaytid="7">Tamsin</span> <span word="Greig’s" data-scaytid="8">Greig&rsquo;s</span> brilliant Fran in Black Books, <span word="‘katzenjammer’" data-scaytid="9">&lsquo;katzenjammer&rsquo;</span> is also German for &lsquo;hangover&rsquo;. See, you like this band already, don&rsquo;t you? <em><span word="IWD" data-scaytid="10">IWD</span>(<span word="WIWA" data-scaytid="11">WIWA</span>)</em> is a chirpy piece of indiepop full of glockenspiel and melodica, that also has a slightly traditional Irish folk dance feel to it. There are some great singalong vocals though, and a sense that you&rsquo;ve stumbled across an exquisitely hewn pop gem that&rsquo;s going to get stuck in your head for a good few days. It&rsquo;s also absolutely perfect for radio, which makes you wonder why it&rsquo;s not completely unavoidable and why <span word="Katzenjammer" data-scaytid="12">Katzenjammer</span> aren&rsquo;t the must-see band of the festival season. Listen to <em><span word="IWD" data-scaytid="13">IWD</span>(<span word="WIWA" data-scaytid="14">WIWA</span>)</em> and you&rsquo;ll smile, you&rsquo;ll dance, you&rsquo;ll play it again as soon as it&rsquo;s finished, and you&rsquo;ll really feel that summer is just around the corner. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Kiwanuka &ndash; I&rsquo;m Getting Ready</strong></p>
<p>The retro-soul sound of singer-songwriter Michael Kiwanuka has already won him the BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2012 poll, as well as plenty of plaudits elsewhere. He almost seems like a man from another era, and in an age of bountiful musical excitement, it seems a little sad that a hotly-tipped artist has to look backwards in time so obviously for inspiration. That said, Kiwanuka&rsquo;s velvety croon is simply gorgeous, and the backing vocals in <em>I&rsquo;m Getting Ready</em> complement his tones perfectly. It&rsquo;s an immersive track, with the feel and structure of an old gospel song. It&rsquo;s so easy and free, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lovely experience just to let the soothing sounds wash over you. Of course, it would be nice if the sound of today didn&rsquo;t sound so indebted to the past but when a song&rsquo;s this good, it&rsquo;s hard to care too much. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West &ndash; Niggas In Paris</strong></p>
<p>It seems odd that a collaboration between arguably the two biggest stars in rap hasn&rsquo;t set the world alight. Sure, there&rsquo;s been plenty of attention on <strong>Watch The Throne</strong>, but nothing like you&rsquo;d expect from the combined pulling power of Jay and Kanye. On <em>Niggas In Paris</em>, the two seem so wrapped up in their own rhymes and style, they&rsquo;ve neglected to give too much attention to what&rsquo;s going on outside of the vocals. This is ill-advised because, while no-one can deny they&rsquo;re mega-stars, Jay-Z and Kanye West aren&rsquo;t huge purely for their technical ability. In fact, on this tired effort, Kanye&rsquo;s annoying drawling is turned up to eleven and there&rsquo;s not much to latch onto. Really, it&rsquo;s just the sound of a pair of gazillionaires boasting about how great they are &ndash; why wouldn&rsquo;t you like it? <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rufus Wainwright &ndash; Out Of The Game</strong></p>
<p>The lesser-talented Wainwright sibling (opinion: reviewer&rsquo;s own) returns with a typically understated effort&hellip; or not. Of course, Wainwright&rsquo;s voice is like incredibly rich food; wonderful to begin with but utterly insufferable if you&rsquo;ve had too much. &lsquo;Too much&rsquo; in this case relates to around 90 seconds or so, and the female backing vocals are just as overpowering. In fairness, Rufus has turned down the melodrama on this <em>Out Of The Game</em> &ndash; there&rsquo;s not a symphony orchestra in sight &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a fairly straightforward, guitar-led track. Yes, there&rsquo;s the odd flourish and an attempt at a big climax (this is Rufus Wainwright after all) but this could be an appropriate entry point for any Rufus non-believers. Overall, it&rsquo;s not too much to get excited about, whether you&rsquo;re a fan or not. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tango In The Attic &ndash; Paw Prints</strong></p>
<p>The new single by Scots Tango In The Attic starts with a statement of intent: huge drums and intense riffing (which sounds awesome on headphones, by the way) that just seem to build and build. By the time the first section is over, we&rsquo;ve got swirly, shoegazey guitars and unusual time signatures for company too. It&rsquo;s a full two minutes before the bass comes in though, and <em>Paw Prints</em> is really missing it until its arrival. Blasts of visceral noise and an intricate structure elevate this above the average and push it in the direction of math-rock, but it can come across as an attempt to mask a lack of quality in the songwriting itself. That said, <em>Paw Prints</em> is certainly worth a listen and will blow the cobwebs away any day of the week. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Weller &ndash; That Dangerous Age</strong></p>
<p>Despite having spent the last decade or more releasing poor facsimiles of former glories, Paul Weller continues to be feted by an ever-fawning music press. Perhaps he&rsquo;s especially nice to journalists, I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, Weller usually seems to be oblivious to the passage of time (and not just in his attitudes to haircuts) but on <em>That Dangerous Age</em>, he addresses his advancing years directly. Much of his latter-day work has been stodgy and bereft of inspiration, but here, there are handclaps, cowbells and a fuzzy bassline you could have a stab at busting a groove to. A welcome change in musical outlook from the man we&rsquo;re contractually obliged to refer to as The Modfather, yet still anything but a classic. That said, not bad for a man on the verge of releasing his eleventh solo studio record. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saint Etienne &ndash; Tonight</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;ll ever be a member of royalty but if the unthinkable does happen, one of my first acts will be to award the members of Saint Etienne a collective knighthood. For over twenty years they&rsquo;ve provided the world with dance music with substance, marvellously bonkers cut and paste albums and a general sense of musical <em>joie de vivre</em>. <em>Tonight </em>harks back to the classic three-minute instant pop of their 90s singles and is impossible to not get caught up in. Gloriously, it&rsquo;s actually about going to a gig, getting caught up in the anticipation and then the <em>&ldquo;surrender to the sound&rdquo;</em> that comes with the best music. A little meta, perhaps, but a hook-filled wonder that never outstays its welcome and leaves you wanting more. Exceptional. <strong>9/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Future Of The Left &ndash; Sheena Is A T-Shirt Salesman</strong></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Song Title of the Week&rsquo; here at The Singles Bar but if we did, this would win by some distance. Either way, it&rsquo;s nice that Sheena is making a living and her days of punk rockerdom didn&rsquo;t leave her entirely employable. <em>SIATS </em>is a breakneck thrash ride that races along without leaving room for you to breathe. There&rsquo;s a hint of a band who are far too pleased with themselves though, and really, attention-grabbing titles aside, this is in no way enjoyable to listen to. Living under a (mainly) Conservative government, I can&rsquo;t help but hope the future of the left is a whole lot brighter than this. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p>A hotly-contested battle ends in victory for the dance-pop trio. I&rsquo;m off to start a countdown to the release of the new Saint Etienne album in May but in the meantime, let us know what you think of this week&rsquo;s choices using the Disqus form below.</p>
