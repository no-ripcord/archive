  <p>There&#39;s been a definite feeling of gloom sweeping across the nation today. After seventeen days of all-out <span word="sportgasm" data-scaytid="1">sportgasm</span>, and a closing ceremony that could be best described as disappointing (yes, it was a slickly put together bit of stadium spectacle, but more fitting for a variety/talent show final rather than the culmination of probably the biggest event to be held in the country in our lifetimes; and there&#39;s something a bit depressing about a vision of Britain entirely consisting of The Beatles, <span word="Britpop" data-scaytid="2">Britpop</span> and bloody awful interpretive dance&nbsp;<strong>4/10</strong>), the Olympics have left town, taking the sunny weather, and the British people&#39;s collective sense of goodwill with it. Even worse, Joe&#39;s off in Milton Keynes, so isn&#39;t able to man The Singles Bar this week, something which I expect the record industry is very much aware of, judging by the uninspiring nature of this week&#39;s releases. Still, maybe <span word="snarkily" data-scaytid="3">snarkily</span> dishing out comments about each one will help us to recapture that fleeting notion of national pride and bring us all together again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>George Michael - White Light</strong></p>
<p>AKA that new track that he was bewilderingly allowed to perform at last night&#39;s festivities (not that the gratuitous plug paid off as apparently it&#39;s failed to break the iTunes Top 10). <em>White Light</em> makes for a really bizarre choice of Olympic-soundtrack (and not the good &quot;<span word="ohmigod" data-scaytid="4">ohmigod</span> they&#39;re playing Fuck Buttons!&quot; sense of bizarre), being painfully clear from the opening gasps of a ventilator that this is about his near-fatal bout of pneumonia last year, and while it may build to a big &quot;I&#39;m alive... I&#39;ve got so much more that I want to do&quot; chorus Michael doesn&#39;t ever manage, or bother, to raise himself above navel-gazing misery. The track&#39;s nocturnal electro is pretty much <em>Fast Love</em> on a particularly strong course of antibiotics, with George offering occasional dips into bad Bowie/good Jimmy <span word="Saville" data-scaytid="5">Saville</span> impersonations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a way, it&#39;s admirable that a star of his stature would feel able to lay his vulnerabilities out so starkly - you certainly wouldn&#39;t catch Elton or Madonna doing the same - and, of course, the fact that he&#39;s still with us is a reason to celebrate, but <em>White Light</em> is nobody&#39;s idea of a celebration.<strong> 4/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aiden <span word="Grimshaw" data-scaytid="6">Grimshaw</span> - Curtain Call</strong></p>
<p>So, what is there to Aiden <span word="Grimshaw" data-scaytid="7">Grimshaw</span>, other than a stint on the X-Factor and a haircut? Based on this I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you. He grumbles like a (thankfully) less offensive James Morrison and is completely upstaged by his backing singer on the chorus, and yet where&#39;s her single? <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Noisettes" data-scaytid="8">Noisettes</span> - That Girl &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I doubt that <span word="Noisettes" data-scaytid="9">Noisettes</span> are anybody&#39;s <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="10">favourite</span> band, but they tend to be good for a decent single now and then, and <em>That Girl</em> is very much one of those. There&#39;s a touch of <span word="doo-wop" data-scaytid="11">doo-wop</span> about it, and a significant amount of borrowing from other artists. In fact I was convinced that it was a cover, but a quick bit of internet-based research suggests that it isn&#39;t. Equal parts naggingly familiar (is that rhythm pinched off <em>Stand by Me</em>, or <em>I Only Want to be With You</em>?) and rather comforting. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Paloma" data-scaytid="12">Paloma</span> Faith - 30 Minute Love Affair</strong></p>
<p>On first listen it&#39;s quite hard to believe that this is <span word="Paloma" data-scaytid="13">Paloma</span> Faith as at no point does it sound like brassy karaoke at the local pub or a foghorn. The mumbled vowels of <em>30 Minute Love Affair</em> suggests she&#39;s attempting to get in on Lana Del Rey&#39;s game, which, while preferable to Faith&#39;s usual act, does seem rather cynical.</p>
<p>Still a bit rubbish, but not outright annoying, which is something, right? <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rita Ora - How We Do (Party)</strong></p>
<p>Despite being one of the biggest hits of the year, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually heard <em>RIP</em>, and <em>How We Do (Party)</em> doesn&#39;t make me want to correct that any time soon. Right from the off Ora irritatingly over-accentuates every vowel, sounding like a cross between P!<span word="nk" data-scaytid="15">nk</span> and a particularly grumpy cat.</p>
<p>Fortunately the track does go against standard pop-writing wisdom by actually dialing things back in the chorus, and at least Ora&#39;s setting her goals realistically low in the &quot;I want to party and bullshit&quot; refrain; she might be a long way off being a decent pop-star, but she&#39;s already more than achieved her rather modest ambitions. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jessie Ware - Wildest Moments</strong></p>
<p>Ware has been riding on a wave of hype and good feeling from the music press (although surely she must be most proud of getting <a href="singles-bar-26th-march-2012.html">a 9/10 review in her debut Singles Bar appearance</a>) and <em>Wildest Moments</em> just about justifies the hype (*hurrah!*)...</p>
<p>I say just about as while Ware&#39;s voice is on fine form, and the drums are <span word="attention-grabbingly" data-scaytid="16">attention-grabbingly</span> insistent, the rest of the song&#39;s a bit <span word="underwhelming" data-scaytid="17">underwhelming</span> in its sketchiness - although the oddly downbeat delivery of its &quot;In our wildest moments / we could be the greatest&quot; message does make it a rather appropriate soundtrack for a country torn between celebrating recent unprecedented sporting success and worrying about where it goes from here. <strong>7/10 - SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Kreayshawn" data-scaytid="18">Kreayshawn</span> - Go Hard</strong></p>
<p><span word="Proto-Swearwave" data-scaytid="21">Proto-Swearwave</span> (I will not rest until <a href="no-ripcast-volume-7.html">No Ripcord&#39;s very own pet-genre</a> receives some official recognition) rapper <span word="Kreayshawn" data-scaytid="19">Kreayshawn</span> divided opinions with her breakthrough <em>Gucci Gucci</em> (personally, I liked it and its unrelenting stupidity). With its slightly cheap cartoon graphics and monotone sing-song quality, <em>Go Hard</em> is no <em>Gucci Gucci</em>, but it is neither offensive nor memorable enough to make me change my mind about her either way. Although I am now tempted to declare her America&#39;s answer to Cher Lloyd. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emily Barker and the Red Clay Halo ft. Frank Turner - Fields of June&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As if The Singles Bar wasn&#39;t looking miserable enough this week, here&#39;s the latest from current backlash-magnet Frank Turner, collaborating with an artist best known for providing the theme to the BBC&#39;s <strong><span word="Wallander" data-scaytid="23">Wallander</span></strong>, and it&#39;s a deadly (in more ways than one) serious murder ballad.</p>
<p>In itself this is no bad thing, but neither Barker nor Turner really have the <span word="gravitas" data-scaytid="24">gravitas</span> or menace to really convince - it&#39;s handsome rather than haunting. I think the word I&#39;m looking for is &quot;passable&quot;, but there&#39;s no real reason for it to exist when The <span word="Decemberists" data-scaytid="25">Decemberists</span> have built a whole career on doing this sort of thing so much better. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span word="Django" data-scaytid="26">Django</span> <span word="Django" data-scaytid="27">Django</span> - Hail Bop</strong></p>
<p>To be honest with you, I&#39;m still not really sold on <span word="Django" data-scaytid="28">Django</span> <span word="Django" data-scaytid="29">Django</span>. <em>Default</em> was good, and there&#39;s something <span word="goofily" data-scaytid="30">goofily</span> pleasurable about their name and image, but, much like their spiritual forebears/actual relations Beta Band, they&#39;re a bit too self-consciously wacky for my taste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that that&#39;s the case on <em>Hail Bop</em> though, which is rather restrained, summer-y pleasant, and fairly forgettable. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers - Strange Man/Long Progression</strong></p>
<p>The first of a promised/threatened nine double A side singles from the funk-rock veterans. Both tracks sound exactly like what you&#39;d expect a post-<strong>By The Way</strong> Red Hot Chili Peppers single to sound like. <strong>Too grim to consider awarding a mark out of ten/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well, at least we have the <span word="Paralympics" data-scaytid="31">Paralympics</span> to look forward to in a couple of weeks, and Joe&#39;s return (should he ever manage to navigate his way out of Milton Keynes) next Monday. I suppose in the meantime we&#39;ll just have to go back to whatever it was that we did for fun before sports fest 2012.... see you all at the local <span word="Wetherspoons" data-scaytid="32">Wetherspoons</span> for a few pints and a punch-up in the car park afterwards then, yeah? &nbsp;</p>
