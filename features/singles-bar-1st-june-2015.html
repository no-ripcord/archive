  <div>Ten tracks. One man. 1,400 words (give or take). It&rsquo;s that there Singles Bar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wctoCxbVj3w"><strong>Devlin &ndash; 50 Grand (feat. <span word="Skepta" data-scaytid="8">Skepta</span>)</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a few years out of the mainstream, grime seems to be undergoing something of a renaissance at the moment, and no artist has <span word="benefitted" data-scaytid="11">benefitted</span> from that more than <span word="Skepta" data-scaytid="9">Skepta</span>. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why Devlin has enlisted him to guest on his new track, but it backfires horribly, as <span word="Skepta’s" data-scaytid="14">Skepta&rsquo;s</span> rhymes truly show up Devlin&rsquo;s inadequacies. Given the <span word="unshowy" data-scaytid="15">unshowy</span>, repetitive backing, <em>50 Grand </em>is clearly set up to be just a vehicle for the talents of Devlin and <span word="Skepta" data-scaytid="10">Skepta</span>, but Devlin just hasn&rsquo;t got the presence to carry this off. <em>50 Grand </em>has plenty of the dark menace that <span word="characterises" data-scaytid="16">characterises</span> much of the best grime but if the genre wants to regain its standing, it&rsquo;s going to need some better tracks than this. <strong>4/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGXBR1wR-mo"><strong>Bear&rsquo;s Den &ndash; Above The Clouds Of Pompeii</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you&rsquo;re thinking Bear&rsquo;s Den is a fairly boring name for a band, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the music they make. To get an idea of what they&rsquo;re about, they&rsquo;re signed to a label co-founded by one of Mumford &amp; Sons, and they&rsquo;ve been in a documentary about touring with Ben Howard. Unsurprisingly, <em>Above The Clouds Of Pompeii </em>is an acoustic number but, taking my cynical hat off, it&rsquo;s not entirely without merit. The picking and main riff are gently pretty and there are some nice, understated touches in the first two thirds. Unfortunately, Bear&rsquo;s Den deem it necessarily to build to a climax that features a banjo and, while it doesn&rsquo;t go as far as Mumford &amp; Son&rsquo;s middle-class hoedowns, it still feels entirely unnecessary. Against the odds, there might be a half-decent band in here. Not yet though. <strong>3/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5A4DnGtis"><strong><span word="Charli" data-scaytid="18">Charli</span> <span word="XCX" data-scaytid="21">XCX</span> &ndash; Famous</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While <span word="Charli" data-scaytid="19">Charli</span> <span word="XCX" data-scaytid="22">XCX</span> hasn&rsquo;t exactly lost her way, long-term fans of her career might be starting to think she can do better than her recent run of singles suggests. <em>Famous </em>follows on from <em>Boom Clap </em>and <em>Break The Rules</em>, and continues their mindless, pop-punk <span word="aesthetic" data-scaytid="24">aesthetic</span> which <span word="characterises" data-scaytid="17">characterises</span> much of her <strong>Sucker </strong>album. <em>Famous </em>is a two-chord wonder that&rsquo;s great fun, but a little disposable and forgettable, even by chart pop standards. That said, <span word="Charli" data-scaytid="20">Charli</span> <span word="XCX" data-scaytid="23">XCX</span> is clearly the most interesting pop star working right now, and there are far worse things to aspire to be than the <span word="21st" data-scaytid="26">21st</span> Century Cyndi <span word="Lauper" data-scaytid="27">Lauper</span>. <strong>7/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVN6FqPpChQ"><strong>Disclosure &ndash; Holding On (feat. Gregory Porter)</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Lawrence brothers are back! <em>Holding On </em>makes great use of the soulful vocals of Gregory Porter, who has risen to popularity in the last twelve months. Despite only being born in the early <span word="1990s" data-scaytid="28">1990s</span>, the Disclosure siblings continue to make music that evokes a time they barely lived through but, as the success of their debut album showed, they&rsquo;ve got a serious knack for it. <em>Holding On </em>is pretty much everything you&rsquo;d want for the comeback single following up a hugely popular first record. It&rsquo;s a killer tune that you can imagine going down a storm at festivals throughout the summer, it hints at something a little different to what&rsquo;s gone before, yet it retains the key elements of Disclosure&rsquo;s previous work. These guys know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing. <strong>8/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKobE-XlwEE"><strong><span word="Moelogo" data-scaytid="30">Moelogo</span> &ndash; My Sweetie (feat. Bunny Mack)</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span word="Afrobeats" data-scaytid="29">Afrobeats</span> has been gradually making its way into the mainstream for a few years now, but arguably, so far only Fuse <span word="ODG" data-scaytid="33">ODG</span> has managed a decent string of hits, while acts like <span word="D’Banj" data-scaytid="35">D&rsquo;Banj</span> remain one-hit wonders in the UK. The African influence in <em>My Sweetie </em>is much more prevalent than on any Fuse <span word="ODG" data-scaytid="34">ODG</span> single, with the irresistible rhythms recalling the energetic <span word="stylings" data-scaytid="36">stylings</span> of high life. Whilst many acts previously have concentrated on completely repackaging African music or <span word="afrobeats" data-scaytid="37">afrobeats</span> in the hope of commercial success, <span word="Moelogo" data-scaytid="31">Moelogo</span> is less willing to conform and, as a result, brings a liveliness and bounce to his music that&rsquo;s rarely seen in the pop charts to this extent. Sadly, the song itself can&rsquo;t live up to the killer backing, but it&rsquo;s still worthy of your time. <strong>7/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssVvkfcL9HI"><strong>Nate <span word="Ruess" data-scaytid="38">Ruess</span> &ndash; Nothing Without Love</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He has an annoying voice, his music is syrupy nonsense, he&rsquo;s signed to a label called Fueled By Ramen, and he&rsquo;s the lead singer of major ear-irritants fun. &ndash; does Nate <span word="Ruess" data-scaytid="39">Ruess</span> have any redeeming features whatsoever? On the evidence of <em>Nothing Without Love</em>, the answer is a fairly resounding &lsquo;no&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s the kind of tortuously plodding ballad that makes Train sound like <span word="Funkadelic" data-scaytid="42">Funkadelic</span>, and is written purely so <span word="Ruess" data-scaytid="40">Ruess</span> can squeeze as much emotion out of it as humanly possible. What Nate <span word="Ruess" data-scaytid="41">Ruess</span> doesn&rsquo;t seem to <span word="realise" data-scaytid="43">realise</span>, however, is that his voice is actually physically unpleasant to hear. His pitch is particularly piercing and makes you shudder involuntarily. It&rsquo;s whiny, <span word="unlistenable" data-scaytid="44">unlistenable</span> rubbish of the highest degree and the thought that anyone might pay money to own this song makes me incandescent with rage. <strong>0/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO0h5LpCjwk"><strong><span word="CamelPhat" data-scaytid="45">CamelPhat</span> &amp; A*M*E &ndash; Paradigm</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For reasons that still aren&rsquo;t particularly clear, A*M*E isn&rsquo;t a world-beating pop singer. Despite possessing everything that you could be looking for in a star, and having even provided the vocals for a chart-topping hit (Duke Dumont&rsquo;s <em>Need U (100%)</em>), the universe at large remains generally impervious to her charms. Perhaps keen to repeat that Duke Dumont-endorsed success, she&rsquo;s teamed up with electro duo <span word="CamelPhat" data-scaytid="46">CamelPhat</span> to guest on a house-inspired number. While it ticks all the boxes theoretically, <em>Paradigm </em>never quite takes off &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to have a focal point or a climax to which everything else was building up to. You&rsquo;d happily dance to this in the middle of a DJ set, but it&rsquo;s not going to ameliorate your experience and it&rsquo;s never going to be the track that stays with you after the night is over. <strong>5/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-SOaSU0ieA"><strong>Lawson &ndash; Roads</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lawson are one of those bands that you know exist, yet can&rsquo;t remember any of their songs, or indeed anything about them. It doesn&rsquo;t help that their name is so similar to <span word="Rixton" data-scaytid="47">Rixton</span> &ndash; another entirely unremarkable pop-rock outfit. Have you ever heard a song by Bastille, The 1975, Maroon 5, The Script, <span word="OneRepublic" data-scaytid="48">OneRepublic</span>, The Fray or Imagine Dragons? Then there&rsquo;ll be absolutely nothing new for you in <em>Roads</em>, which is a nearly packaged three and a half minutes of no consequence which, somehow, you&rsquo;re able to forget while it&rsquo;s still actually playing. There is literally no point to any of this. <strong>1/10&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12aX6fKuDfs"><strong>O-Town &ndash; Skydive</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reunions nobody asked for: part 362. For the uninitiated (you lucky people, you), O-Town were one of the very first bands put together through a reality TV show (MTV&rsquo;s <strong>Making The Band</strong>) and are best remembered for their genuinely uncomfortable hit <em>Liquid Dreams</em>, which is about exactly what you think it is. There seems to be an unwritten rule that <span word="boyband" data-scaytid="49">boyband</span> members aren&rsquo;t allowed to sing anything remotely upbeat once they&rsquo;re over thirty years old and, as a result, <em>Skydive</em> is an overwrought power ballad, the type you&rsquo;ve heard a million times before. You can imagine the single fist clenching that signifies deep emotion. Once the track builds to its most intense point, if you listen very carefully, there&rsquo;s a bit in the backing track that sounds a little like <em>Flashing Lights</em> by <span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="50">Kanye</span> West. That&rsquo;s genuinely the only thing remotely interesting about this song, and that&rsquo;s stretching the definition of &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; to breaking point. <strong>1/10</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zqdo_Umd5c"><strong>Natalie La Rose &ndash; Somebody (feat. <span word="Jeremih" data-scaytid="52">Jeremih</span>)</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The opening of <em>Somebody </em>sounds a tiny bit like <em>I Can&rsquo;t Wait </em>by Nu <span word="Shooz" data-scaytid="54">Shooz</span> which, let&rsquo;s be honest, can only be a good thing. Fans of <span word="Jeremih’s" data-scaytid="55">Jeremih&rsquo;s</span> recent hit single <em>Don&rsquo;t Tell &lsquo;Em </em>will hear lots of elements they&rsquo;re familiar with in this song, which also appropriates Whitney Houston&rsquo;s <em>I <span word="Wanna" data-scaytid="56">Wanna</span> Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) </em>in the chorus. This is a decent enough tune but, much like the <span word="CamelPhat" data-scaytid="51">CamelPhat</span> and A*M*E track above, it never really gets out of second gear. In case you&rsquo;re wondering about lyrical themes, La Rose and <span word="Jeremih" data-scaytid="53">Jeremih</span> are in &ldquo;the club&rdquo;, so much like 99% of other pop stars these days &ndash; it&rsquo;s a wonder anything gets done really. <strong>4/10</strong></div>
