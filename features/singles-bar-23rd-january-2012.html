  <p>One of the joys of getting to write The Singles Bar on a weekly basis is the sheer variety of music you get to hear &ndash; old and new, mainstream and obscure. In just a dozen tracks below, we cover the return of a singer well into his 70s, the latest single from music&rsquo;s great new hope, African-tinged R&amp;B, Caribbean pop, hip-hop, soul, country and more. Of course, if you listen to any twelve songs released on a given day, the chances are one of them will be by David <span word="Guetta" data-scaytid="1">Guetta</span>, and so it proves here. So, if you&rsquo;re sitting comfortably, I shall begin.</p>
<p><strong><span word="Nerina" data-scaytid="2">Nerina</span> <span word="Pallot" data-scaytid="3">Pallot</span> &ndash; All Bets Are Off</strong></p>
<p>Our first song wastes no time in getting started; there&rsquo;s no time for anything fussy like &ldquo;intros&rdquo; with <em>All Bets Are Off</em>. <span word="Pallot’s" data-scaytid="4">Pallot&rsquo;s</span> voice is like a slightly more gutsy Norah Jones and the music&rsquo;s even more tasteful. A perfectly nice mid-tempo, slightly rocky track with a sweet melody and eager strings at every turn but that&rsquo;s all it is &ndash; nice. It&rsquo;d be almost impossible to dislike this song but by the same token, I can&rsquo;t really see how you could passionately love it either. I do wonder why people dedicate their lives to making music like this, but then again, there&rsquo;s plenty about this world I don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s completely fine, but doesn&rsquo;t tickle my fancy in the slightest I&rsquo;m afraid. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Charlotte <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="5">Gainsbourg</span> &ndash; Anna</strong></p>
<p>Singer, actress, real-life French person &ndash; is there anything Charlotte <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="6">Gainsbourg</span> can&rsquo;t do? Her last album, <strong><span word="IRM" data-scaytid="7">IRM</span></strong>, was a disappointment and contained little of the elegant beauty that made its predecessor, <strong>5:55</strong>, really stand out. However, on the evidence of <em>Anna</em>, <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="8">Gainsbourg</span> has decided to pursue the direction introduced on <strong><span word="IRM" data-scaytid="9">IRM</span> </strong>&ndash; a direction that&rsquo;s not particularly inventive or exciting, and one that puts her back amongst the crowd. Of course, there&rsquo;s still that croaky voice with its prim vowels and deliciously enunciated consonants, but <em>Anna </em>has no dynamic, no jeopardy, no direction, and it&rsquo;s disheartening to hear. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arctic Monkeys &ndash; Black Treacle</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, despite only just being old enough to have left their paper-rounds behind, it seems Arctic Monkeys are forever destined to spend their career failing to replicate the magic and electricity that resulted in their record-breaking debut LP. <em>Black Treacle</em> sounds like the kind of track Arctic Monkeys wouldn&rsquo;t have even put on an album five years ago, let along released as a single. There&rsquo;s a tired, sludgy pace to the song, and although Alex Turner&rsquo;s lyrics are still reasonably sharp, even he seems bored by the whole affair. Maybe that&rsquo;s the point and with a name like <em>Black Treacle</em>, it&rsquo;s some kind of quasi-onomatopoeic satire designed to make music critics look stupid. Either way, like Charlotte Gainsbourg above, it&rsquo;s disappointing when an artist you love is making music of such inferior quality to their zenith. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lana Del Rey &ndash; Born To Die</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the review of the new Lana Del Rey single, <em>Born To Die</em>. I&rsquo;d like to make one thing clear: I shall be reviewing the content of the song, and that alone. I shall not be reviewing her background and childhood, nor shall I be reviewing her appearance and the poutiness of her lips. I&rsquo;m also not going to review her previous work under her real name and I&rsquo;m not going to review her &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; or &ldquo;realness&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m fed up of it and I don&rsquo;t wish to align myself with the myriad, pretentious, white, misogynistic, self-appointed arbiters of taste that appear to have engulfed the internet in the last six months.</p>
<p>Anyway, the track then. The tone of Del Rey&rsquo;s voice is still something I&rsquo;m finding difficult to warm to, and there&rsquo;s always a suspicion with her work that the abundance of strings is masking something, such as the lack of a tune, perhaps. However, the more <em>Born To Die</em> progresses, the more Del Rey&rsquo;s vulnerabilities come to the surface, the less assured she seems, and the more emotionally affecting the track becomes. The huge drum crashes in the chorus provide a stark contrast to the restraint of the vocals and while it&rsquo;s a little too similar to <em>Video Games</em>, taken in isolation it&rsquo;s probably a better track. See, it is possible to review her music properly. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen &ndash; The Darkness</strong></p>
<p>Like the later work of Johnny Cash, there&rsquo;s an ominous mood and, yes, a darkness to this track right from the get-go. The guitar figure is simple &ndash; quick, finger-picked arpeggios finished with a two note riff, repeated over a twelve bar blues pattern &ndash; yet it&rsquo;s incredibly effective. Also, Cohen&rsquo;s voice is absolutely extraordinary, a low rumble that sounds effortless yet like it&rsquo;s lived several lives too. The tone only really changes from throaty growl to hushed whisper, but holds the listener entirely rapt. It&rsquo;s an old cliché, but Cohen could sing the phone book and it would sound great. The saxophone and the female backing vocals are a little on the schmaltzy side perhaps, but those are the only criticisms of what is a fantastic comeback single. <strong>9/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amadou &amp; Mariam feat. Santigold &ndash; Dougou Badia</strong></p>
<p>There are some collaborations that fill you with excitement before you&rsquo;ve heard a note of the music and this is one such example. The Malian husband and wife duo have teamed up with boundary-ignoring singer/producer Santigold for <em>Dougou Badia</em>. It&rsquo;s the collision of African and Western influences you&rsquo;d expect, and the squealing, atmospheric guitar lines are supplied by Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs. There&rsquo;s a lovely feel to this track which gives it the sense that you could quite happily listen to an hour of stuff that sounded a bit like this. Despite its wonderful elements, there&rsquo;s something a little lacking in execution and the spark <em>Dougou Badia</em> requires never quite arrives. A minor quibble perhaps, but it&rsquo;s one that prevents a good song becoming a great one. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professor Green &ndash; Never Be A Right Time</strong></p>
<p>Inexplicably popular rap wally Professor Green seems to be keen on revealing his sensitive side. However, in this poorly-written wallow-fest, he seems to be so morose he&rsquo;s forgotten to write the lyrics until he got to the studio, giving the feeling he&rsquo;s making it up on the spot. That&rsquo;s the only explanation for the constant repetition, the lines that don&rsquo;t quite fit properly and have syllable stresses in awkward places, and the sheer awfulness of some of Green&rsquo;s &ldquo;rhymes&rdquo; (<em>&ldquo;Struggling to find the way to word it / And I&rsquo;m supposed to be a wordsmith&rdquo;</em>). The gospel-lite melody in the chorus is simply dull and it sounds like Professor Green&rsquo;s hardly bothered with this track. It would have been better for everyone if he hadn&rsquo;t bothered at all. <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ren Harvieu &ndash; Through The Night</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually pretty much reviewed this track before for No Ripcord in this article <a href="new-2012-critics-choice.html">here</a>, so apologies if I repeat myself slightly if I repeat myself slightly (LOL, ROFL, etc.). BBC Sound of 2012 Longlist nominee Ren Harvieu has a simply gorgeous voice; one that envelops and comforts, and one that &ndash; given the right material &ndash; could see her pressing the buttons of consumers and industry tastemakers worldwide. Like the rest of her available material, there&rsquo;s a strong 1960s, Dusty Springfield feel to <em>Through The Night</em>, and even though the build-up to the chorus is clearly signposted, the unexpected chord change at the crucial point still induces goosebumps when played at a certain volume. Expect to hear a lot more about Ren Harvieu as 2012 progresses. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Guetta feat. Sia &ndash; Titanium</strong></p>
<p>That David Guetta just will not go away, will he? As much as I admire anyone with a strong work ethic, his monopolising of the charts and commercial radio has reached critical mass, and the very mention of his name is enough to make me rock gently in a corner, weeping like a broken shell of a man. However, can the delightful and underrated Sia bring any respite to the Guetta juggernaut? Well, not really. Sia&rsquo;s idiosyncratic voice brings such much needed humanity and warmth to Guetta&rsquo;s faceless, club-friendly creations, but as the track builds, Sia&rsquo;s voice strains and the techno tosspot ends up drowning out the only good thing on the track. There&rsquo;s an appealing chord progression buried somewhere here, it&rsquo;d be really interesting to hear an acoustic version of <em>Titanium </em>if one exists where the vocals don&rsquo;t need to struggle so much. As it is, the unfortunate Guettaisation of music continues apace. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bon Iver &ndash; Towers</strong></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m by no means the biggest fan of Bon Iver or his alt. country, mountain-dwelling beardy ilk, I&rsquo;ll happily concede his records contain some genuinely heart-melting, beautiful moments. However, <em>Towers </em>isn&rsquo;t one of them. When the drums and backing vocals finally come in at around the two minute mark, it&rsquo;s a welcome change of pace, but nothing more. The sound of a full band certainly suits Bon Iver more than the lone woodsman sound, but the double-tracked falsetto is now merely annoying, and there&rsquo;s little of substance going on in <em>Towers </em>to lift it away from the realm of the forgettable. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cover Drive &ndash; Twilight</strong></p>
<p>After the horrific <em>Lick Ya Down</em> didn&rsquo;t sound the death knell for the atrocious Cover Drive, they&rsquo;ve decided to bestow a new single upon us. Like <em>Lick Ya Down</em>, it follows all the tropes of mega-selling dance-pop in the 2010s while adding a few Caribbean rhythms. If you&rsquo;re thinking that sounds like an inferior version of a Rihanna record, then you&rsquo;d be exactly correct, because that&rsquo;s pretty much what <em>Twilight </em>is. Just when you think it&rsquo;s reached its nadir, there&rsquo;s an exceptionally weak rap that&rsquo;s slathered with layers of autotune. Also, oddly for dance-pop, it seems to be at slightly too slow a tempo to actually dance to, which means it basically fails on all fronts. Well done, everyone involved in this, you should be proud &ndash; have you ever thought of turning your skills to running the world&rsquo;s largest financial institutions? <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flo Rida feat. Sia &ndash; Wild Ones</strong></p>
<p>After years of being largely ignored, it appears Sia has chosen January 2012 to make her bid for global domination, being involved in two singles with pop mega-stars released on the same day. The good news is that Mr. Rida hasn&rsquo;t decided to murder the Suede classic, but the bad news is that <em>Wild Ones</em> is another Ibiza-influenced club track that completely wastes Sia&rsquo;s talents. Flo Rida gives the impression of being an incredibly impatient man who can&rsquo;t wait to &ldquo;get the party started&rdquo; so has to repeatedly add huge beats and jump in for a verse when the song&rsquo;s progressing perfectly well without him. In case you&rsquo;re wondering about the lyrical content of <em>Wild Ones</em>, I&rsquo;m struggling to penetrate the multiple gnomic doctrines of Flo Rida but I think it&rsquo;s about what a thoroughly marvellous chap he is, how he&rsquo;s exceptionally popular with members of the opposite sex and how he enjoys nothing more than having a jolly time with some of his closest friends. Marvellous. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
