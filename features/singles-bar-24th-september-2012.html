  <p>I write about films mostly. I am terrible at keeping up with that pop music they have now. The last single I bought was in 2002 and I listen almost exclusively to music performed by dead men with beards. That said, I did use to work in an office where the music channels were played around the clock, yet with the volume muted, meaning I&rsquo;ve seen quite a lot of videos without ever actually hearing the people behind them. So I&rsquo;ve seen Jessie J, Lady Gaga, <span word="N-Dubz" data-scaytid="1">N-Dubz</span>, Nicki&nbsp;<span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="2">Minaj</span> and <span word="LMFAO" data-scaytid="3">LMFAO</span> (R.I.P.) all <span word="poncing" data-scaytid="4">poncing</span> about in their videos, but not heard a note of their music. I could pick them out of a line up, but what they sound like, who knows? I certainly don&rsquo;t. For these stated reasons, I&rsquo;m the PERFECT person to review this week&rsquo;s new releases!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te712XaVMgM"><strong>Deaf Havana - <span word="Hunstanton" data-scaytid="5">Hunstanton</span> Pier</strong></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from East Anglia and so are Deaf Havana, who have penned a little song about shit seaside town <span word="Hunstanton" data-scaytid="6">Hunstanton</span>. They paint a gloomy picture, one of wasted youth and missed opportunity, of wanting to escape the humdrum existence of life in a shit seaside town. It&rsquo;s an overwrought affair and no mistake. As songs about bleak prospects in run down tourist resorts go, it&rsquo;s not quite Atlantic City. Especially not with lyrics like, <em>&quot;Lee and me were schooled in a tourist town / With less culture than Jeremy Kyle&quot;</em>. Cheer up lads, you&rsquo;ve got a <span word="Sealife" data-scaytid="8">Sealife</span> Centre. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5W7DVFKrcs"><strong>Jennifer Lopez feat. Flo <span word="Rida" data-scaytid="9">Rida</span> - <span word="Goin" data-scaytid="10">Goin</span>&#39; In</strong></a></p>
<p>Now, I have definitely heard of this J.Lo character. That said, I was completely taken in by her song <em>Jenny From The Block</em>, in which she clearly stated that she was just a humble young lady from the Bronx. How shocked I was to find out she was a multi-millionaire diva! I was totally fooled by the rocks that she got. Fool me once, shame on you, so there&rsquo;s no fooling me a second time with this hideous noise. It&rsquo;s loud, obnoxious sound. That&rsquo;s all I really have to say for the track. Lyrically, she and Mr. <span word="Rida" data-scaytid="11">Rida</span> &nbsp;combine for some amazing call-and-response action such as:</p>
<div><strong>J.LO:</strong> It&#39;s &#39;go&#39; time, press my button, yeah, blow the stage</div>
<div><strong><span word="RIDA" data-scaytid="13">RIDA</span>:</strong> Grenade!</div>
<div><strong>J.LO:</strong> Oh my, tonight we <span word="goin" data-scaytid="15">goin</span>&#39; <span word="orang-utan" data-scaytid="16">orang-utan</span></div>
<div><strong><span word="RIDA" data-scaytid="14">RIDA</span>:</strong> Bananas!</div>
<p>Quite. A travesty on many levels, especially in the video, in which she looks like the woman from the Scottish Widows advert who has had her mouth <span word="vajazzled" data-scaytid="17">vajazzled</span>. <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRBlvPVhkGI"><strong>Joss Stone - Pillow Talk</strong></a></p>
<p>Ah, young Miss Stone, where have you been? Last I saw her, she was mugging her way through that Live 8 song with Justin Hawkins. Since that, I&rsquo;ve not heard a peep, so I just assumed she&rsquo;d either retired or died. On this evidence, she&rsquo;s still going. <em>Pillow Talk</em> is an inoffensive bit of breathy soul warbling. A bit Minnie <span word="Ripperton" data-scaytid="18">Ripperton</span>, a bit Millie Jackson. Not much more to it than that. It&rsquo;ll probably be used on an advert very soon. I&rsquo;ve already forgotten what it sounds like. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZxPsLjinP4"><strong>Kindness - That&#39;s Alright</strong></a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about Kindness. I think he likes the <span word="1980s" data-scaytid="19">1980s</span> though. Big <span word="synths" data-scaytid="20">synths</span> aplenty and vocal samples evoke everything from the New Power Generation to <span word="Yello" data-scaytid="21">Yello</span>. And not in a particularly good way. Sounds like that song from the nightclub scene in <span word="RoboCop" data-scaytid="22">RoboCop</span>, if that means anything to you people. Points for gusto though. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA3bc-3p0"><strong>Lana Del Rey - Blue Velvet</strong></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I didn&rsquo;t doubt Ms. Del Rey&rsquo;s artistic integrity, as this cover of old staple <em>Blue Velvet</em> for high street chain H&amp;M (for whom she is also <span word="modelling" data-scaytid="23">modelling</span> the Autumn/Winter Collection) proves that she is by no means a corporate <span word="schill" data-scaytid="24">schill</span>. It sounds exactly like Lana Del Rey covering <em>Blue Velvet</em>, but dressed in a brown suede seasonal jacket (<span word="£99" data-scaytid="25">&pound;99</span>) and tube scarf (&pound;7.99). Flaccid. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3SmDScjjY"><strong>Nelly <span word="Furtado" data-scaytid="26">Furtado</span> - Spirit Indestructible</strong></a></p>
<p>Nelly <span word="Furtado" data-scaytid="27">Furtado</span> is like a bird, i.e. she shits on cars. She also has the most nasal voice I think I&rsquo;ve ever heard. A bit like she&rsquo;s singing with a whole peg bag on her nose. She also pronounces &quot;indestructible&quot; as &quot;<span word="indistructabowel" data-scaytid="29">indistructabowel</span>&quot;, which makes it sound like she has a cast iron digestive system. That said, I can&rsquo;t stomach this lazy nonsense, which is basically just some drums and a woman with a whole peg bag on her nose. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo"><strong>The Poke &amp; Alex Ross - Nick Clegg Says I&#39;m Sorry (The <span word="AutoTune" data-scaytid="30">AutoTune</span> Remix)</strong></a></p>
<p>Now this is the real deal. When the Right <span word="Honourable" data-scaytid="31">Honourable</span> Nick Clegg MP was talked into doing a hand-wringing video apology for breaking an election promise by his advisors, they must&rsquo;ve known it&rsquo;d be chopped up, flipped over and royally buggered. That said, I bet they didn&rsquo;t expect it to be done so artfully as this. <span word="Autotune" data-scaytid="32">Autotune</span> is old hat, but this one is so ruddy good it both re-invents and kills the form. It&rsquo;s the Once Upon A Time In The West of <span word="Autotune" data-scaytid="33">Autotune</span> videos, if you will. <strong>8/10 - SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/youre-the-best/id559766604?i=559766615&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><strong><span word="Nik" data-scaytid="34">Nik</span> Kershaw - You&#39;re The Best</strong></a></p>
<p>The presence of Ipswich&rsquo;s <span word="Nik" data-scaytid="35">Nik</span> Kershaw alongside those miserable sods from <span word="Hunstanton" data-scaytid="36">Hunstanton</span> lends this week&rsquo;s Singles Bar a somewhat East <span word="Anglian" data-scaytid="39">Anglian</span> feel. With only a mere 51 seconds of this song available online, it&rsquo;s quite a hard single to review. Musically, those 51 seconds are rubbish. This snippet also features the lyrics,&nbsp;<em>&quot;You&rsquo;re the wham / You&rsquo;re the bam / You&rsquo;re the thank you and the ma&rsquo;am&quot;</em>. I&rsquo;ll give those 51 seconds <strong>2/10</strong> with both marks being for going to the same school as me.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/35814567"><strong>Any Color Black &ndash; You</strong></a></p>
<p>This band should be called Any Color Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, with whom they share the same overdriven groove. As I stick my nose in and inhale the bouquet, I also detect notes of The Duke Spirit. In short, not the freshest sounding song you&rsquo;ll hear this year, but also far from the worst, if you like that sort of thing. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/tallships/gallop"><strong>Tall Ships &ndash; Gallop</strong></a></p>
<p>Regrettably not a song about public polls or dressage, but an <span word="anthemic" data-scaytid="40">anthemic</span>, wall of sound that starts with Adam Ant style drums before building into something quite grandiose. It&rsquo;s a little bit Doves, which is no bad thing. Well done Tall Ships for being good at music! <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for listening pop pickers!</p>
<p>So, what do you make of Joe&#39;s views? Agree, disagree, or just agree to disagree? As always, let us know using the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="41">Disqus</span> form below.</p>
