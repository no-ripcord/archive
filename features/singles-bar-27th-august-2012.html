  <p>Finally, the curse is over! After more than twelve months of good reviews being pretty much synonymous with awful sales, Sam &amp; The <span word="Womp" data-scaytid="1">Womp</span> have rushed to the top of the UK charts off the back of an 8/10 in <a href="singles-bar-20th-august-2012.html">last week&rsquo;s Singles Bar</a>. Having scoured the music press, I don&rsquo;t see the group thanking this column directly, but I suspect it&rsquo;s only a matter of time. Now, let&rsquo;s see who we can catapult to commercial success with the Midas Touch this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/presley-johnson/anitas-last-dance"><strong>Presley Johnson &ndash; Anita&rsquo;s Last Dance</strong></a></p>
<p>We start this week&rsquo;s Singles Bar with a track that spends its first five seconds doing a horrifying impression of Snow Patrol&rsquo;s interminable <em>Chasing Cars</em>. However, we&rsquo;re soon into the real meat of the song, and <em>Anita&rsquo;s Last Dance</em> reveals itself to be a very competent take on the folk-rock genre. There are fiddles and close harmonies, but don&rsquo;t mistake Presley Johnson for the dreaded <span word="Mumfords" data-scaytid="3">Mumfords</span>, as this is a far more enjoyable proposition. In fact, its closest big name contemporary is probably Fleet Foxes. <em>Anita&rsquo;s Last Dance</em> has a tendency to put the brakes on just when it&rsquo;s starting to look lively which is a little frustrating, but that shouldn&rsquo;t detract from what is ultimately a fine example of <span word="songcraft" data-scaytid="4">songcraft</span>. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQWAk92KEa8"><strong>Cover Drive feat. <span word="Dappy" data-scaytid="5">Dappy</span> &ndash; Explode</strong></a></p>
<p>As has been covered before here at The Singles Bar, when two terrible artists collaborate, it&rsquo;s actually a good thing because it&rsquo;s preventing two separate songs being released to the world. At least, that&rsquo;s what the questionable science behind this theory tells me. <em>Explode </em>is, like every other Cover Drive effort, a pretty standard chart dance-pop track with some Caribbean rhythms thrown in, like a cut-price Rihanna. The album version of this song (yes, I know, the lengths I go to) doesn&rsquo;t feature rapping ignoramus <span word="Dappy" data-scaytid="6">Dappy</span>, and his presence undoubtedly worsens an already sub-standard song. The chorus has a decent hook to it though, which in the worlds of <span word="Dappy" data-scaytid="7">Dappy</span> and Cover Drive, represents a ground-breaking work of genius. <strong>3/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM-9dlD3ac0"><strong>Alyssa Reid feat. Snoop Dogg &ndash; The Game</strong></a></p>
<p>After her hit single <em>Alone Again</em>, with everybody&rsquo;s favourite rap crew, Jump Smokers (no, me neither), Alyssa Reid returns with Snoop Dogg to&hellip; hang on, isn&rsquo;t he Snoop Lion now? Anyway, anyone expecting a glimpse of Snoop&rsquo;s new reggae direction will be sorely disappointed by <em>The Game</em>. A bit of research reveals Alyssa Reid took the Bieber route to fame by being spotted singing on YouTube, but it&rsquo;s difficult to understand what she&rsquo;s got that thousands of other wannabes haven&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s a very indistinct voice in an already overcrowded market, and she simply comes across as an inferior version of fellow Canadian Carly Rae Jepsen. <em>The Game</em> is a track in the Disney Channel-friendly style, and instantly forgettable, which makes the presence of Snoop all the more puzzling. Remember when he had some scruples? <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0reAgBMYA"><strong>Alanis Morissette &ndash; Guardian</strong></a></p>
<p>The sub-editor&rsquo;s least favourite singer, Alanis Morissette (always remember &ndash; one &lsquo;r&rsquo;, two &lsquo;s&rsquo;s), has been doing plenty of promo ahead of the release of her new album. Hilariously, she&rsquo;s revealed herself to be possibly the least self-aware person ever, claiming to be &ldquo;helping evolution&rdquo; and detailing her dislike of &ldquo;alpha-alpha relationships&rdquo;. After years in the commercial wilderness, <em>Guardian </em>has a more grungy sound that harks back to her <strong>Jagged Little Pill</strong> heyday. However, it&rsquo;s missing that something indefinable that her best tracks had, and instead sounds like the unmissed wave of pop-grunge from the early 90s (think Four Non Blondes or Third Eye Blind). Still, artists with a ridiculously inflated sense of self-worth are what pop music thrives upon, so it&rsquo;s nice to have her back. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5VNumNJyqE"><strong>Friends &ndash; I&rsquo;m His Girl</strong></a></p>
<p>This is actually a re-release of a single from late last year. If only some enterprising independent music and film website had flagged it up as a great track months and months ago. <a href="new-2012-critics-choice.html">Oh wait&hellip;</a> So, almost a year on and <em>I&rsquo;m His Girl</em> is still a fantastic track. The confidence of Friends to be so minimalistic and employ such a clear funk influence is to be commended, and that swagger comes across in the lyrical content too. Not a spare ounce of fat exists on <em>I&rsquo;m His Girl</em>, and the fact it threatens to turn into <em>Rapper&rsquo;s Delight</em> halfway through with a cowbell breakdown can only be a good thing. Friends&rsquo; album, <strong>Manifest!</strong>, could have done with a few more songs that matched <em>I&rsquo;m His Girl</em>&rsquo;s level of quality. One more tip: check out the B-side, a cover of the Ghost Town DJ&rsquo;s track, <em>My Boo</em>, which is, if anything, even better. <strong>9/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-bv3Oz448"><strong>Fazer &ndash; Killer</strong></a></p>
<p>Search Wikipedia for &ldquo;Tulisa&rdquo; and you get the page for Tulisa of N-Dubz. Search Wikipedia for &ldquo;Dappy&rdquo; and you get the page for Dappy of N-Dubz. Search Wikipedia for &ldquo;Fazer&rdquo; and you get the page for a Finnish food corporation. Herein lies the problem with Fazer; not as photogenic as Tulisa, not as outspoken as Dappy, he seems destined to be the least conspicuous member of N-Dubz. He&rsquo;s also the last to launch his solo career, and his lack of profile looks like it&rsquo;ll harm him here too. <em>Killer </em>sounds like a Chris Brown track with Fazer&rsquo;s vocals auto-tuned to the point of auditory discomfort and a try-too-hard dubstep breakdown in the place of a hook or a decent chorus. There&rsquo;s a kind of brooding, bass-y menace to <em>Killer </em>which adds a soupçon of darkness but overall, it&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;d expect really. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNXybY2DtwM"><strong>Two Door Cinema Club &ndash; Sleep Alone</strong></a></p>
<p>Two Door Cinema Club have managed to build a decent fanbase, a growing profile and a large amount of critical acclaim without ever having done anything particularly spectacular. It seems no-one has profited more from the dearth of decent guitar music at the moment than them. <em>Sleep Alone</em> is another entirely passable effort, with a pulsating hi-hat rhythm and weaving guitar lines in a compact, perfunctory chorus. TDCC give the impression of a band who disguise their paucity of ideas behind thrusting tempos and <em>Sleep Alone</em> is another example of that. I&rsquo;ve mentioned before my difficulty in distinguishing Two Door Cinema Club and Bombay Bicycle Club. I think I&rsquo;ve got it now though &ndash; Bombay Bicycle Club are the good ones. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haGtWXElfhw"><strong>Scouting For Girls &ndash; Summertime In The City</strong></a></p>
<p>Is it too much to ask to have anything, just a little something, with a hint of substance or intelligence in a Scouting For Girls song? Apparently yes, but then again, what would you expect from a group with such a wretched name? Unsurprisingly, <em>Summertime In The City</em> starts with repeated piano chords to the beat and a standard SFG lyric: <em>&ldquo;Summertime in the city, all the girls dress hot and the boys go silly&rdquo;</em>. In the entire history of popular music, it&rsquo;s difficult to recall a band with as little to say as Scouting For Girls; they make Scooch look like Tom Waits. I&rsquo;m almost jealous of their incredibly simplistic view to life and music, but then I realise that five minutes in their company is likely to make you want to attempt to lobotomise yourself with a teaspoon. <strong>0/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugItUYMaOQ8"><strong>Dinosaur Jr. &ndash; Watch The Corners</strong></a></p>
<p>An awful lot of Dinosaur Jr.&rsquo;s appeal (or lack of) is down to how you react to J Mascis&rsquo; distinctive voice. Personally, I often find it a barrier to their songs but given enough listens, the strength of the band&rsquo;s material overrides his idiosyncratic style. On <em>Watch The Corners</em>, Dinosaur Jr. sound as if they haven&rsquo;t realised it&rsquo;s no longer 1993 but with the way trends in music go, this bizarrely makes them seem bang up-to-date. <em>Watch The Corners</em> builds from an inauspicious beginning to a real rocking-out anthem with a killer solo over layers and layers of huge guitar. Dinosaur Jr. should be applauded for still making singles this relevant and fantastic so long into their career. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl_UGpHlgRs"><strong>Halfway To New York &ndash; What A Way To Go</strong></a></p>
<p>To finish, we go from the veteran rockers to the new kids on the scene. Fresh from supporting Bruce Springsteen at Hard Rock Calling, four-piece Halfway To New York look to capitalise on that exposure with their latest single. The chugging guitar lines are a little uninspiring, but the vocal melody soars far above them and makes <em>What A Way To Go</em> the kind of thing that would jump through the radio speakers at you. Lyrically, it leans on the tropes of rock n&rsquo; roll excess a little too keenly, but there&rsquo;s a deft professionalism at work here, and HTNY are the sort of band who should be rubbing shoulders with Snow Patrol and their ilk (I say rubbing shoulders, they&rsquo;re clearly better than Gary Lightbody&rsquo;s group). A little retro, perhaps, but there&rsquo;s a huge audience for this kind of straight-up rock, and given the right exposure, Halfway To New York could be selling out a venue near you soon. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>For the first time, we&rsquo;ve included links to all the tracks, so why not have a listen and let us know what you think? There&rsquo;s a Disqus form below and everything.</p>
