  <p>Despite my claim last week that The Singles Bar is the most comprehensive singles review you&rsquo;ll find anywhere (in fact, I&rsquo;m choosing to view it as the British record buying public deliberately making me look like a fool), this week&rsquo;s number one &ndash; the grammatical nightmare/terrible pun that is <span word="Labrinth’s" data-scaytid="1">Labrinth&rsquo;s</span> <em>Beneath Your Beautiful</em> &ndash; was completely overlooked by us.</p>
<p>This week, will I attempt to right this wrong and give it a review?</p>
<p>Nah, as <span word="Labrinth’s" data-scaytid="4">Labrinth&rsquo;s</span> now squeezed six singles out of his debut he&rsquo;s had more than enough attention from us recently, plus there are plenty of more worthy tracks out there looking for someone to haphazardly review them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://thetakeaway.bandcamp.com/album/days-and-nights-at-the-takeaway-10-october"><strong>Sebastian <span word="Rochford" data-scaytid="8">Rochford</span> &amp; Oliver Coates - The Boat Sails To A Blind Horizon</strong></a></p>
<p>Admittedly, we&rsquo;ve given <span word="Seb" data-scaytid="6">Seb</span> <span word="Rochford’s" data-scaytid="10">Rochford&rsquo;s</span> <em>Days And Nights At The Takeaway</em> series a fair bit of coverage, but with good reasons, not least because a man so thoroughly committed to such a mind-boggling fantastic hair-do fully deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Entry number ten in the series; <em>The Boat Sails To A Blind Horizon</em>, sees <span word="Rochford" data-scaytid="11">Rochford</span> take something of a backseat at first, giving the spotlight to cellist Oliver Coates and, more unexpectedly, <span word="avant-garde" data-scaytid="15">avant-garde</span> composer <span word="Krzysztof" data-scaytid="16">Krzysztof</span> <span word="Penderecki" data-scaytid="17">Penderecki</span> whose influence can be heard all over Coates&rsquo; stabs and dying swan swoops, and perhaps even in the murky electronics and irregular drumming <span word="Rochford" data-scaytid="12">Rochford</span> later contributes (and as such it could nicely capture the interest stirred in <span word="Penderecki" data-scaytid="18">Penderecki</span> from Halloween viewings of <strong>The Shining</strong> and <strong>The Exorcist</strong>). Like most contemporary jazz, it definitely isn&rsquo;t something to be listened to &lsquo;for fun&rsquo;, but it is unusual in that it operates far more on an emotional than an intellectual level, which makes it more than worthy of investment, even if the remix from Acoustic <span word="Ladyland’s" data-scaytid="19">Ladyland&rsquo;s</span> Chris <span word="Sharkey" data-scaytid="20">Sharkey</span> on the B-side is pretty much the same thing, just with more reverb. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LdXp8DQ9JE"><strong>The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart &ndash; Jeremy/My Life Is Wrong</strong></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, largely down to the preciousness of that name, but I am an obsessive Magnetic Fields nerd, and all for more recordings of <span word="Stephin" data-scaytid="21">Stephin</span> Merritt-penned tunes being released into the world. For the lead track of this one-off single, <span word="TPOBPAT" data-scaytid="22">TPOBPAT</span> have taken a track from the Fields&rsquo; often overlooked second album <strong>The Wayward Bus</strong>, and <span word="reimagined" data-scaytid="23">reimagined</span> it in the style of some of their college radio contemporaries back in &rsquo;92, replacing the dinky <span word="synths" data-scaytid="24">synths</span> of the original in <span word="favour" data-scaytid="25">favour</span> of <span word="shoegaze-y" data-scaytid="26">shoegaze-y</span> guitar squalls, and even a well-placed solo. Although the sharpness of Merritt&rsquo;s lyrics gets lost in the mix somewhat it&rsquo;s still an excellent combination, which arguably even outshines the original. <strong>8/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeumyOzKqgI"><strong>Adele &ndash; <span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="27">Skyfall</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m as bored as Adele as the next right-thinking person (although, judging by the still mammoth sales of <strong>21</strong>, we seem to be a <span word="worryingly" data-scaytid="80">worryingly</span> small minority), but <em><span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="28">Skyfall</span></em> is a pretty good Bond theme; definitely the best of the Craig era, although that&rsquo;s not saying much in itself. In addition to ticking off the boxes of what you&rsquo;d expect from a Bond song &ndash; vowels stretched to breaking point; mostly nonsensical lyrics delivered with such drama that they must be euphemisms for something - it also manages the impressive feat of lodging itself firmly in the head after one listen. Largely, it must be said, this is because most of <em><span word="Skyfall" data-scaytid="29">Skyfall</span></em> is made up of bits from other themes, that have been drummed into our collective subconscious through years of TV repeats, but as there&rsquo;s been so much banging on about this being the <span word="50th" data-scaytid="33">50th</span> anniversary of the franchise, that&rsquo;s probably the point. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers &ndash; The Sunset Sleeps Tonight/Hometown Gypsy / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93C6_X49ZoI">My Chemical Romance &ndash; Conventional Weapons: Number One</a></strong></p>
<p>As my dislike of the Chili Peppers has been well documented in this column, and as<em> The Sunset Sleeps Tonight</em> sees them operating at a more annoying level than usual, thanks to Antony <span word="Kiedis’" data-scaytid="34">Kiedis&rsquo;</span> added country-style hooting, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d be giving the latest release in their 7&rdquo; series a good review, so let&rsquo;s just skip over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it turns out that they&rsquo;re not the only established band doing the &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a load of tracks that we didn&rsquo;t think were good enough for release on an album, but will expect fans to buy as overpriced singles&rdquo; thing (admittedly, I am aware that the same thing could be said about the <span word="Seb" data-scaytid="35">Seb</span> <span word="Rochford" data-scaytid="36">Rochford</span> single, but as I like it I&rsquo;m choosing to potentially make myself look like a hypocrite by ignoring that&hellip; plus, <span word="y’know" data-scaytid="39">y&rsquo;know</span>, he&rsquo;s got that hair).</p>
<p>Having the emotional maturity of a fairly sulky 15 year old, I have a fair amount of time for My Chemical Romance, especially when they&rsquo;re at their most bombastic and ridiculous. <em>Boy Division</em>, the A-Side of this first single taken from their aborted <strong>Conventional Weapons</strong> album, is definitely plenty of the former (quite literally so, in all their yelling about how they&rsquo;ve &lsquo;got the bomb&rsquo;) but not enough of the latter. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSOu2ShQHY0"><strong>Ethan Johns &ndash; Whip Poor Will</strong></a></p>
<p>Given the BRIT awards&rsquo; predilection for all things glossy and silly, it was a bit odd that veteran <span word="folky" data-scaytid="40">folky</span>, <span word="beardy" data-scaytid="41">beardy</span> type Johns walked away with the prize for Best British Producer this year. <em>Whip Poor Will</em> precedes his own forthcoming debut album, and comes practically screaming about its cameos from Ryan Adams and Laura Marling, amongst others. Even if it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make out what any of them are contributing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is, as you&rsquo;d expect with the talent involved, handsomely done, but also so <span word="anaemic" data-scaytid="42">anaemic</span> and innocuous that I can&rsquo;t think of a single compelling argument for its existence. <strong>4/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHiww8ELGYk">John Wean &ndash; M.A.P.</a></strong></p>
<p>John Wean come with a misleading name (they&rsquo;re a four piece, none of whom are called John), comparisons to The View and recommendations from the likes of <span word="Fearne" data-scaytid="43">Fearne</span> Cotton, but let&rsquo;s not hold all that against them, as <em>M.A.P.</em> (it stands for Morning After Pill, apparently) is a rather refreshing blast of youthful noise, that I&rsquo;m probably too old to be listening to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think the <span word="scuzzy" data-scaytid="44">scuzzy</span>, <span word="jangliness" data-scaytid="45">jangliness</span> of Arctic Monkeys at the height of their popularity, played on fast-forward, slightly at the expense of comprehensibility when it comes to the wittily gritty lyrics, and you&rsquo;re pretty much there. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQTVZrK91GA">Post War Years &ndash; The Bell EP</a></strong></p>
<p>On the subject of comparisons, <a href="singles-bar-16th-july-2012.html">Post War Years&rsquo; previous appearance in The Singles Bar</a> saw the name of The Human League being thrown about a bit (which is a very good thing, in case you were wondering). However, while Joe expressed concerns then that they really weren&rsquo;t bringing anything new to the party, I&rsquo;m a bit more disappointed to find that they are on their latest release, as its various bleeps and <span word="bloops" data-scaytid="46">bloops</span> are far more New Rave than New Romantic. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine, if a bit unmemorable, but by going for something a bit more up-to-date, they&rsquo;ve oddly ended up sounding a bit less current. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0osXTPmNkAw">Wave Machines &ndash; Ill Fit</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit surprised to find that Wave Machines are still going. Not that I mean that in an unpleasant way (unlike, say, The Twang, who also have<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUu1W9PWlq0"> a new single</a> out today despite an overwhelming lack of demand - unsurprisingly, it&rsquo;s an <span word="unlistenable" data-scaytid="62">unlistenable</span> load of old shit), but rather that I admire their perseverance for carrying on despite their always the bridesmaid/never the bride/perennial support act status.</p>
<p>Despite a new found confident funkiness &ndash; I think they listened to a lot of Prince over the several years since the release of their first album &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure<em> Ill Fit</em> will do much to change matters, unfortunately, as it seems to have come at the expense of their ability to come up with a breezily melancholic melody. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys7-6_t7OEQ&amp;feature=branded"><br /><strong>Justin Bieber Featuring Nicki <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="47">Minaj</span> - Beauty And A Beat</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Beauty And A Beat</em> contains a lot that&rsquo;s wrong about pop music today &ndash; autotune, <span word="‘dubstep’" data-scaytid="52">&lsquo;dubstep&rsquo;</span> breakdowns, and, arguably, a shoehorned-in verse from Nicki <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="50">Minaj</span> - and comes with a found-footage gimmick of a video which makes precisely no sense, but thanks to keeping those factors to a minimum, and the general professionalism of the <span word="Biebs" data-scaytid="54">Biebs</span>, it actually works. Still, in the unlikely event that I get invited to one of Justin&#39;s soirees, I think I might decline &ndash; sure, the waterpark-based fun and games in the video look like suitably wholesome good time (although how they managed to get away with the choreographed dance routine in the shallow end without incurring the wrath of the life guard on duty I don&rsquo;t know), but I fear when he mentions partying &ldquo;like it&rsquo;s 3012&rdquo; (kudos to the writers for being considerably more forward thinking than Prince and future proofing the song&rsquo;s radio-friendliness) he means &lsquo;hanging out in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, fighting to death over the last scraps of canned food&rsquo;. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtOV7bp-gys"><strong>Robbie Williams &ndash; Candy</strong></a></p>
<p>A week might be a long time in the go-go world of singles reviewing, but I&rsquo;m still a bit annoyed with <a href="singles-bar-22nd-october-2012.html"><span word="Shinies" data-scaytid="55">Shinies</span> and their self-indulgent nostalgic naval gazing</a>. Perhaps this will serve as a reminder that the nineties weren&rsquo;t all that, as it was the time when Robbie Williams stood unchallenged as the nation&rsquo;s biggest pop star.<br />As what must be his third &lsquo;comeback&rsquo; (at least) by now, Candy contains pretty much all of the elements that made him so staggeringly successful to begin with. In other words, it sounds like an obnoxiously chipper, slightly reggae (in the <span word="UB40" data-scaytid="56">UB40</span> sense of the word) take on <em>Stand By Me</em>, with rhyming couplets so astoundingly awful that attempting to make any sense out of them could result in a brain <span word="tumour" data-scaytid="57">tumour</span>. <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On that <span word="unsavoury" data-scaytid="58">unsavoury</span> note, that&rsquo;s it for my two week stint managing The Singles Bar. I&rsquo;ve never been very good at goodbyes, so let&rsquo;s just leave it at &quot;Why not offer your thoughts in the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="59">Disqus</span> box below?&quot;.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
