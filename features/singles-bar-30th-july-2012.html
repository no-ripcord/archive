  <p>At Singles Bar HQ, fewer than forty miles from the Olympic Park, we&rsquo;ve been celebrating the finest athletes in the world pushing their bodies to the limit of human <span word="endeavour" data-scaytid="1">endeavour</span> in the only way we know how &ndash; sitting in front of the television all weekend and roaring advice to these finely honed specimens while we <span word="hoover" data-scaytid="2">hoover</span> up junk food. Of course, the real story for music fans was the fantastic medley in the opening ceremony (we also loved the NHS tribute, artistic, Socialist, lentil-munching, <span word="yoghurt-knitting" data-scaytid="3">yoghurt-knitting</span> <span word="leftie" data-scaytid="4">leftie</span> liberals that we are) which ran from The Beatles to <span word="Tinie" data-scaytid="5">Tinie</span> <span word="Tempah" data-scaytid="6">Tempah</span> via Bowie, Blur and more. All of which makes this week&rsquo;s selection that much more of an ordeal&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Drake feat. The <span word="Weeknd" data-scaytid="7">Weeknd</span> &ndash; Crew Love</strong></p>
<p>Never knowingly short on confidence, Drake recently told The Jewish Chronicle that he was &ldquo;the first person to successfully rap and sing&rdquo; (which, as <span word="Popjustice" data-scaytid="8">Popjustice</span> pointed out, cruelly ignores <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NHMHMIRhX4"><span word="Alesha" data-scaytid="9">Alesha</span> Dixon&rsquo;s contribution</a> to the world of music). However, on <em>Crew Love</em>, Drake hands melody duties to The <span word="Weeknd" data-scaytid="10">Weeknd</span>, and the two poster boys for solipsistic, minimalist, first-world-problem rap certainly don&rsquo;t disappoint. He may not be the first to rap and sing, but Drake deserves some credit for taking music so <span word="uncommercial" data-scaytid="12">uncommercial</span> into the mainstream. It doesn&rsquo;t have traditional choruses, it doesn&rsquo;t rely on bells and whistles, and it&rsquo;s defiantly simple. <em>Crew Love</em>, while lyrically a little on the generic side, is another great track from Drake, and maybe it&rsquo;ll push The <span word="Weeknd" data-scaytid="13">Weeknd</span> to more sales-based success too. <strong>7/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>A$AP Rocky &ndash; Goldie</strong></p>
<p>A$AP Rocky and his crew won plenty of friends, admirers and column inches last year with their Southern-influenced hip-hop tales of purple drank on the <strong><span word="LiveLoveA" data-scaytid="15">LiveLoveA</span>$AP</strong> <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="16">mixtape</span>, and now it&rsquo;s time for the official releases. Like the <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="17">mixtape</span>, <em>Goldie </em>suffers from paucity of ideas in places, and it&rsquo;s an almost stream-of-consciousness flow that&rsquo;s simply one long verse with a repeating woodwind (piccolo?) riff that&rsquo;s gratingly <span word="twee" data-scaytid="18">twee</span> after a while. Rocky&rsquo;s style is great, and he&rsquo;s certain to be around for a long while yet, but it doesn&rsquo;t get the juices flowing in anticipation of his debut album. <em>Goldie </em>shows promise, but it&rsquo;s perhaps a step back from the man who brought us <em>Peso </em>et al. <strong>6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wiley feat. Ms D &ndash; <span word="Heatwave" data-scaytid="19">Heatwave</span></strong></p>
<p>Wiley recently claimed to The Guardian that he &ldquo;could have been as big as <span word="Tinie" data-scaytid="20">Tinie</span> <span word="Tempah”" data-scaytid="23">Tempah&rdquo;</span> and &ldquo;anyone from [the grime] scene can play the O2 if they make the right music.&rdquo; Sour grapes, perhaps? While Wiley&rsquo;s seen his contemporaries from the early days of grime, most notably <span word="Dizzee" data-scaytid="24">Dizzee</span> Rascal, storm to success in recent years, Wiley&rsquo;s remained on the outside, with little more than the odd critical ovation to his name. Those who know Wiley might point to his profligacy, unpredictability and, ahem, use of relaxing substances as more pertinent reasons as to why he&rsquo;s not bothering the traffic systems of North Greenwich. Strange then, that <em><span word="Heatwave" data-scaytid="21">Heatwave</span> </em>is Wiley&rsquo;s most blatant bid for commercial success than his last big chart hit, <em>Wearing My Rolex</em>. Wiley&rsquo;s never dull and his flow and rhymes are engaging and propel the song along on a pulsing rhythm, but Ms. D&rsquo;s contribution, a chart-friendly, facile ode to partying, drags the track down into a less exciting realm, and the overriding feeling in this track is one of unfulfilled promise.<strong> 5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yolanda Be Cool feat. Crystal Waters &ndash; Le Bump</strong></p>
<p>Yolanda Be Cool are the artists behind the irritatingly ubiquitous monster hit, <em>We No Speak Americano</em>, so please try and contain your excitement at their return. Here, they&rsquo;ve teamed up with Crystal Waters, best known in the UK for her classic <span word="earworm" data-scaytid="26">earworm</span> <em>Gypsy Woman (La <span word="Da" data-scaytid="27">Da</span> Dee La <span word="Da" data-scaytid="28">Da</span> <span word="Da" data-scaytid="29">Da</span>)</em>. Like <em>We No Speak Americano</em>, there are annoying brass riffs and a bizarre <span word="fetishisation" data-scaytid="33">fetishisation</span> of big band music. That&rsquo;s all that really separates it from a million other <span word="Europop" data-scaytid="34">Europop</span> smashes of the past two decades or so and, without a memorable hook to speak of, is likely to disappear from your mind the second it finishes. The same can&rsquo;t be said of <em>Gypsy Woman (La <span word="Da" data-scaytid="30">Da</span> Dee La <span word="Da" data-scaytid="31">Da</span> <span word="Da" data-scaytid="32">Da</span>)</em> though, which I&rsquo;ll now probably be humming for the next fortnight. <strong>2/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parade &ndash; Light Me Up</strong></p>
<p>Girl group Parade scored a Top 10 hit last year with the frankly dismal <em>Louder </em>before seemingly disappearing without a trace. Usually, in these situations it signals the end of a career altogether (yes, you Girl Thing, and you Girls@Play, and whither Precious?) but against all odds, Parade are back. And to be perfectly honest, it&#39;s a good job they are, because <em>Light Me Up</em> is a huge-sounding record which doesn&#39;t exactly reinvent the wheel but does pure pop in an unabashed, full-force way that a lot of groups could learn from. The Saturdays had better watch their backs because if <em>Light Me Up</em> gets any decent airplay and Parade have got a few more songs like this up their sleeve, they could well be going places fast. <strong>8/10</strong></p>
<p><strong><span word="M83" data-scaytid="40">M83</span> &ndash; OK Pal</strong></p>
<p><span word="M83" data-scaytid="41">M83</span> breaking into the UK Top 40 singles chart still feels a bit like a dream that didn&rsquo;t happen and the more I hear of <span word="M83" data-scaytid="42">M83</span>, I can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re so critically acclaimed. This isn&rsquo;t to say the work of Antony Gonzalez is bad, far from it, but <span word="M83’s" data-scaytid="44">M83&rsquo;s</span> style is so kitsch, is so in thrall to music that&rsquo;s often not fondly remembered, and is so openly pop-focused that it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that&rsquo;s normally met with a sneer by earnest, <span word="beardy" data-scaytid="45">beardy</span>, Appalachian woodsman-loving hipper-than-thou <span word="folkie" data-scaytid="46">folkie</span> types. However, anyone not letting <span word="M83" data-scaytid="43">M83</span> into their life is missing out, because <em>OK Pal</em> is life-affirming, uplifting music that seeks the beauty in the world, amplifies it and then chucks a load of star-sprinkled <span word="synths" data-scaytid="48">synths</span> all over the top of it. It&rsquo;s a rich chocolate cake of a track, maybe a little rich over a whole album (and don&rsquo;t forget <span word="M83’s" data-scaytid="47">M83&rsquo;s</span> last was a double) but utterly fantastic over four minutes. Stick it on repeat, lose any notion you may have of what <span word="tastemakers" data-scaytid="50">tastemakers</span> say you should be listening to, and if you&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s putting pressure on your cheeks, that&rsquo;ll be the massive grin spreading across your face. <strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong><span word="Rumer" data-scaytid="51">Rumer</span> &ndash; Sara Smile</strong></p>
<p>The last time <span word="Rumer" data-scaytid="52">Rumer</span>, aka Sarah Joyce, turned up on the Singles Bar, I questioned the point of her career (although I hope I was a bit nicer than that about it) but said she had a decent voice. Well, now she&rsquo;s put her voice to good use with this cover of a Hall &amp; Oates track. Her velvety, Karen <span word="Carpenter-esque" data-scaytid="54">Carpenter-esque</span> croon works well with the jazz-flecked blue-eyed soul of the original and serves to remind you what a great song this is. The production is a little muddled &ndash; <span word="Muzak" data-scaytid="55">Muzak</span> backing vocals and a little too much going on in the instrumental breakdown, perhaps &ndash; but <span word="Rumer" data-scaytid="53">Rumer</span> steers this ship well all told. It doesn&rsquo;t improve on the original in any way though, so again, it&rsquo;s difficult to see the reasoning behind this. But then maybe that&rsquo;s my problem and I should just concentrate on whether her records are any good or not that try and solve any existential questions through the medium of a mildly successful singer. <strong>5/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chemical Brothers &ndash; Theme From <span word="Velodrome" data-scaytid="60">Velodrome</span></strong></p>
<p>So, <em>Theme From <span word="Velodrome" data-scaytid="61">Velodrome</span></em> is the official song of the London 2012 Olympics. But hang on, isn&rsquo;t that Muse abomination the official song too? And I&rsquo;m sure I heard <span word="Dizzee" data-scaytid="56">Dizzee</span> Rascal was doing one? That&rsquo;s not to mention that awful Mark <span word="Ronson" data-scaytid="64">Ronson</span> and Katy B thing that turned up endorsed by a certain teeth-dissolving soft drinks company. Seems like the <span word="organisers" data-scaytid="65">organisers</span> want to have their cake (made by the official bakers of the London 2012 Games, <span word="natch" data-scaytid="66">natch</span>) and eat it. <em>Theme From <span word="Velodrome" data-scaytid="62">Velodrome</span></em> starts off with epic <span word="synths" data-scaytid="58">synths</span> before a <span word="Kraftwerkian" data-scaytid="68">Kraftwerkian</span> <em><span word="“VEL" data-scaytid="69">&ldquo;VEL</span>. O. DROME.&rdquo;</em> looms over the top and Orbital-style <span word="synth" data-scaytid="70">synth</span> patterns pepper the building beats. The whole thing gives a real sense of intensity and cumulative <span word="endeavour" data-scaytid="59">endeavour</span>, though it&rsquo;s not surprise a track with such an obvious <span word="motorik" data-scaytid="72">motorik</span> motif and repetitive riffs should be associated with cycling. It&rsquo;s a defiantly non-commercial choice from the always-interesting <span word="Chems" data-scaytid="73">Chems</span> (though a radio edit is available) though it remains to be seen whether Sir Chris <span word="Hoy" data-scaytid="74">Hoy</span> and Vicky Pendleton <span word="whizz" data-scaytid="75">whizz</span> their way round The Pringle (that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re calling it) to this, but either way, it&rsquo;s a brilliant song, <span word="ravey" data-scaytid="76">ravey</span> yet still cerebral. Dance&rsquo;s love affair with cycling continues. <strong>9/10 &ndash; SINGLE OF THE WEEK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Far East Movement feat. Cover Drive &ndash; Turn Up The Love</strong></p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s wrong to be against people by name alone but consider this. Far East Movement are <span word="Kev" data-scaytid="77">Kev</span> <span word="Nish" data-scaytid="78">Nish</span>, <span word="Prohgress" data-scaytid="79">Prohgress</span>, <span word="J-Splif" data-scaytid="80">J-Splif</span> and DJ <span word="Virman" data-scaytid="81">Virman</span>. Cover Drive have a member named Bar-Man. Sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to do the right thing. Responsible for a handful of genuinely awful singles between them, the two quartets join forces which, on paper, looks tragic for anyone in the possession of functioning ears. Both groups attempt to stamp their particular styles on this track, so Cover Drive&rsquo;s Caribbean-influenced pop meets Far East Movement&rsquo;s boneheaded club rap. It&rsquo;s a trick that&rsquo;s been done relatively seamlessly before, but these two make it look like a combination that&rsquo;s about as well-suited as cod and custard. A pretty sorry exercise with *counts on fingers* precisely no redeeming features. <strong>0/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calvin Harris feat. Example &ndash; We&rsquo;ll Be Coming Back</strong></p>
<p>The two artists who rival Rihanna for sheer output come together presumably in a concerted attempt to save effort and only do half a track each. Their musical styles are so similar that it seems strange they decided to work together at all. They&rsquo;ve clearly suffering from dance music fatigue (I know the feeling) because this is barely a track at all. It&rsquo;s more like a mechanically recovered Calvin Harris or Example song, with tired keyboards, a lazy tempo and an uninspired vocal. Boring, boring, boring, this has got contractual obligation written all over it (the song, not this column, how dare you even suggest that). <strong>1/10</strong></p>
<p>Has the arrival of the Games actually made us patriotic all of a sudden? More likely it&rsquo;s just another track of great quality from the Chemical Brothers. Let us know what you think using the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="82">Disqus</span> form below.</p>
