  <p><span>You thought it was gone, but for one week only, The Singles Bar is back and bigger than ever!</span></p>
<p><span>As you may or may not know/care, the </span><a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/"><span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="1">Eurovision</span></a><span><a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/"> Song Contest</a> final is being held on </span><span word="18th" data-scaytid="3">18th</span><span> May in </span><span word="Malmö" data-scaytid="4">Malmö</span><span>, Sweden, with semi-finals on the </span><span word="14th" data-scaytid="5">14th</span><span> and </span><span word="16th" data-scaytid="6">16th</span><span>. So what better way to introduce you to the multitude of acts performing than a special edition of The Singles Bar? We&rsquo;ve listened to all thirty-nine (yep, you read right) and will be giving you the lowdown on each one over the course of four articles, before revealing the victor at the end.</span></p>
<p><span>A handy tip to fully enjoy the article; before listening to each track, imagine a short video advertising the main talking points of the country in question &ndash; perhaps something about its nice hills, steel industry or near-exemplary health and safety record.</span></p>
<p><span>NB: As this is </span><span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="7">Eurovision</span><span>, scores are awarded out of twelve (or <span word="“douze”" data-scaytid="11">&ldquo;douze&rdquo;</span>, for the full authentic experience) rather than the normal ten. Also, as </span><span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="8">Eurovision</span><span> is renowned for it, we&rsquo;ll be keeping a cumulative count of all the key changes along the way.</span></p>
<p><span>Flags and national headdress at the ready? Let&rsquo;s dive in!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pf-ZCI-UuA&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUJw7z5JozgKaeLhhaMQbmpA"><strong><span>Albania: Adrian <span word="Lulgjaraj" data-scaytid="12">Lulgjaraj</span> and <span word="Bledar" data-scaytid="13">Bledar</span> <span word="Sejko" data-scaytid="14">Sejko</span> &ndash; <span word="Identitet" data-scaytid="15">Identitet</span> (English: Identity)</span></strong></a></p>
<p>And so the long and arduous journey begins. <em><span word="Identitet" data-scaytid="16">Identitet</span> </em>is sung entirely in Albanian, which makes it a little difficult to fairly <span word="analyse" data-scaytid="19">analyse</span> its lyrical contents. Musically though, it&rsquo;s dramatic, pop-focused <span word="goth-rock" data-scaytid="20">goth-rock</span>, with OTT string arrangements and some ridiculous guitar shredding before the final chorus. For no apparent reason, the first verse is sung in a creepy rasp by someone who resembles an uncle who likes to pat your thigh and say, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you growing up quickly?&rdquo; (my money&rsquo;s on that being <span word="Sejko" data-scaytid="17">Sejko</span>), but then vocal duties for the rest of the track are, thankfully, handed over to the other one, who resembles an Eastern European, eyeliner-less Billie Joe Armstrong. <em><span word="Identitet" data-scaytid="18">Identitet</span> </em>is a pretty reasonable tune, though it hasn&rsquo;t really got the killer ingredient to make it stand out. The video is worth a look too, where it appears <span word="Lulgjaraj" data-scaytid="23">Lulgjaraj</span>, <span word="Sejko" data-scaytid="24">Sejko</span> and band are playing in a disused <span word="multi-storey" data-scaytid="27">multi-storey</span> car park&hellip; for some reason. <strong>7/12</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSs03Sp-4ME&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUJw7z5JozgKaeLhhaMQbmpA"><strong>Armenia: <span word="Dorians" data-scaytid="29">Dorians</span> &ndash; Lonely Planet</strong></a></p>
<p>In the UK, we regard <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="28">Eurovision</span> as kitsch and treat it with an ironic distance whilst moaning about tactical voting like some kind of swivel-eyed <span word="UKIP" data-scaytid="32">UKIP</span> xenophobe. However, some other countries see it as a chance to present themselves on a greater stage and do things properly, hence you get this bizarre situation where Armenia&rsquo;s entry has been co-written by TONY FLIPPING <span word="IOMMI" data-scaytid="33">IOMMI</span>! Research reveals that <span word="Dorians" data-scaytid="30">Dorians</span> are actually a pretty big deal in their native Armenia, having won numerous awards and supported <span word="Serj" data-scaytid="34">Serj</span> <span word="Tankian" data-scaytid="35">Tankian</span>. <em>Lonely Planet</em> is a soft-rock ballad with the occasional crunch of guitar that contains vague platitudes about peace and living in harmony, always a neat trick when attempting to get Europe to unite behind you (though it&rsquo;d likely go down like a lead balloon should the UK attempt it). Like <em><span word="Identitet" data-scaytid="36">Identitet</span> </em>before it, there&rsquo;s some decent shredding before the final chorus which is heralded by &ndash; oh yes, a key change &ndash; and soaring vocals from <span word="Gor" data-scaytid="38">Gor</span> <span word="Sujyan" data-scaytid="39">Sujyan</span>. Lyrically simplistic (though props to anyone who can pen a song in a language not their own) but again, not bad at all. <strong>7/12</strong></p>
<p><em>Key change count: 1</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RPLzJ5hqYc&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Austria: <span word="Natália" data-scaytid="41">Natália</span> Kelly &ndash; Shine</strong></a></p>
<p>Despite only being born in 1994, Kelly&rsquo;s got some pedigree. She&rsquo;s been performing for a decade, was part of a children&rsquo;s pop group signed to Universal, and won a solo contract after appearing in the Austrian version of The Voice. But enough cribbing from Wikipedia &ndash; what about the song? It&rsquo;s got more of an American <span word="flavour" data-scaytid="42">flavour</span> than we&rsquo;re used to from <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="40">Eurovision</span> entries (hardly surprising, given Kelly&rsquo;s American heritage) but it&rsquo;s a fairly insipid, say-nothing, mid-tempo ballad with chugging guitars and vaguely &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; lyrics. Presumably due to a paucity of ideas, after the second chorus there&rsquo;s a key change and some vocal gymnastics. It&rsquo;s fair to say we&rsquo;ve heard all this before but what&rsquo;s most surprising is how long ago we heard it. Despite Kelly&rsquo;s youth, <em>Shine </em>sound more like a third division Meredith Brooks rip-off, and despite her pleading, I&rsquo;ve no desire to <em>&ldquo;fight the shadows in the sky&rdquo;</em> (mainly because you only get shadows on an actual surface &ndash; basic science there). <strong>3/12</strong></p>
<p><em>Key change count: 2</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5egVzkZGTg&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUJw7z5JozgKaeLhhaMQbmpA"><strong>Azerbaijan: <span word="Farid" data-scaytid="44">Farid</span> <span word="Mammadov" data-scaytid="45">Mammadov</span> &ndash; Hold Me</strong></a></p>
<p><span word="Mammadov’s" data-scaytid="46">Mammadov&rsquo;s</span> biography says that outside of music, he enjoys Greco-Roman wrestling and <span word="capoeira" data-scaytid="47">capoeira</span>, so I&rsquo;d best be careful about what I say. That does raise the interesting prospect of <em>Hold Me</em> being a song about grappling though. Upon listening, it appears there&rsquo;s no such luck, and it&rsquo;s a piano-led ballad about love and that, which sounds more like a song from a musical. <span word="Mammadov’s" data-scaytid="48">Mammadov&rsquo;s</span> got a decent set of pipes on him though, and there&rsquo;s an effortless ease to his performance which makes <em>Hold Me</em> a lot more palatable than it might be otherwise. Watching his performance (there seems to be no actual music video available), it&rsquo;s hard not to notice that, extraordinary eyebrows aside, Mr. <span word="Mammadov" data-scaytid="50">Mammadov</span> is indeed rather dreamy. However, not dreamy enough that you don&rsquo;t notice the key change at the end. <strong>5/12</strong></p>
<p><em>Key change count: 3</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4S4m9R-ffA&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Belarus: <span word="Alyona" data-scaytid="53">Alyona</span> <span word="Lanskaya" data-scaytid="54">Lanskaya</span> &ndash; <span word="Solayoh" data-scaytid="56">Solayoh</span></strong></a></p>
<p>It seems there&rsquo;s more than a touch of controversy surrounding the <span word="Belorussian" data-scaytid="58">Belorussian</span> entry. <span word="Lanskaya" data-scaytid="55">Lanskaya</span> was initially chosen to represent Belarus in last year&rsquo;s <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="52">Eurovision</span>, but was later disqualified after it was discovered the voting had been rigged. After winning this year&rsquo;s selection process fair and square, she dropped the victorious song in <span word="favour" data-scaytid="60">favour</span> of another, which hardly seems like cricket. That said, it looks to have been a wise choice, as <em><span word="Solayoh" data-scaytid="57">Solayoh</span> </em>is a catchy, hook-filled blast of <span word="Europop" data-scaytid="61">Europop</span> that sounds like a cross between Holly Valance&rsquo;s <em>Kiss Kiss</em> and <em><span word="Bamboléo" data-scaytid="63">Bamboléo</span> </em>by The Gipsy Kings. Fluffy and inconsequential, yes, but good fun, and would probably sound about five times as good on a Mediterranean beach (and yes, I&rsquo;m fully aware Belarus has no coastline). <span word="Lanskaya" data-scaytid="62">Lanskaya</span> also looks to win the award for most obviously telegraphed key change, as the song seems to spend about twenty seconds building up to the inevitable. <strong>8/12</strong></p>
<p><em>Key change count: 4</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9uExokZcIM&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Belgium: Roberto <span word="Bellarosa" data-scaytid="65">Bellarosa</span> &ndash; Love Kills</strong></a></p>
<p>He may only be eighteen, but Roberto <span word="Bellarosa" data-scaytid="66">Bellarosa</span> is another one with pedigree in his homeland, having won the Walloon version of The Voice (there are two versions of the show in Belgium) and enjoyed two Top 5 singles since (including a version of <em>Jealous Guy</em>). It&rsquo;s an interesting diversion into music because, as his bio suggests, &ldquo;his childhood was ruled by the number of football goals scored by the men in the family&rdquo;, which sounds like no way to <span word="instil" data-scaytid="67">instil</span> a system of discipline. For the first minute, <em>Love Kills</em> is the kind of bore-ballad you associate with talent show winners, but then it suggests it&rsquo;s going to go into <span word="hi-NRG" data-scaytid="69">hi-NRG</span> chaos. It doesn&rsquo;t quite do that, but there are plenty of <span word="synths" data-scaytid="70">synths</span> and it gains a fair bit of bite. Then we&rsquo;ve the trendy, <span word="quasi-dubstep" data-scaytid="71">quasi-dubstep</span> breakdown and it seems Roberto <span word="Bellarosa" data-scaytid="68">Bellarosa</span> is Belgium&rsquo;s answer to Justin Bieber in more ways than one. It&rsquo;s rousing in the way these things often are, but it sounds like an opportunity has been missed to turn <em>Love Kills</em> into a real club banger. <strong>6/12</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bExp3aNOFsE&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUJw7z5JozgKaeLhhaMQbmpA"><strong>Bulgaria: <span word="Elitsa" data-scaytid="73">Elitsa</span> <span word="Todorova" data-scaytid="74">Todorova</span> and <span word="Stoyan" data-scaytid="75">Stoyan</span> <span word="Yankulov" data-scaytid="76">Yankulov</span> &ndash; <span word="Само" data-scaytid="77">Само</span> <span word="шампиони" data-scaytid="78">шампиони</span> (English: Only Champions)</strong></a></p>
<p><span word="Todorova" data-scaytid="79">Todorova</span> and <span word="Yankulov" data-scaytid="80">Yankulov</span> have previous &ndash; they represented Bulgaria at the 2007 contest and achieved the country&rsquo;s highest placing to date. On <em><span word="Само" data-scaytid="83">Само</span> <span word="шампиони" data-scaytid="84">шампиони</span></em>, they&rsquo;ve gone for the tried and tested <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="85">Eurovision</span> trope of combining poppers o&rsquo; clock trance with national folk music. This is why we&rsquo;re treated to the bonkers spectacle of lots and lots of drums, some <span word="none-more-dubstep" data-scaytid="91">none-more-dubstep</span> <span word="wubwubwubs" data-scaytid="92">wubwubwubs</span>, and a man playing what looks like a vacuum cleaner bag with a descant recorder stuck in the end. Does it work? No, of course it doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; are you crazy? Yet there&rsquo;s something infectious about how mad the whole thing is which gives it a sort of awkward charm. If we&rsquo;re going to <span word="criticise" data-scaytid="93">criticise</span> legitimately, the melody of the chorus contains too much minor key to match the triumphant nature of the song and the <span word="perma-grinning" data-scaytid="94">perma-grinning</span> video, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that on our annual visit to <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="86">Eurovision</span> land, you can always be assured of finding something like this. <strong>8/12</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdESBf3UFQI&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Croatia: <span word="Klapa" data-scaytid="99">Klapa</span> S Mora &ndash; <span word="Mižerja" data-scaytid="100">Mižerja</span> (English: Misery)</strong></a></p>
<p>All you need to know about this is contained on the <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="95">Eurovision</span> website: <span word="“Klapa" data-scaytid="103">&ldquo;Klapa</span> singing is a traditional Croatian form of vocal music originating from <span word="Dalmatia" data-scaytid="104">Dalmatia</span>, in southern Croatia. In December 2012, UNESCO inscribed <span word="klapa" data-scaytid="105">klapa</span> singing on its list of world intangible heritage of Europe. This year Croatia has formed a special <span word="klapa" data-scaytid="106">klapa</span> for the <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="96">Eurovision</span> Song Contest made up of singers who are young, but rich in experience.&rdquo; Sounds, amazing, right? Well, yes, until you <span word="realise" data-scaytid="108">realise</span> that <span word="klapa" data-scaytid="107">klapa</span> singing is extraordinarily dull. It&rsquo;s a form of a cappella gospel music, so while <em><span word="Mižerja" data-scaytid="109">Mižerja</span> </em>contains beautiful moments of harmony, there&rsquo;s still little to get excited about, and the attempt to appropriate a traditional medium for mass consumption with the addition of a drum machine seems a little crass. They&rsquo;ll almost certainly be the most technically gifted vocalists in the competition though. <strong>4/12</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEd1TsVBo9U&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Cyprus: <span word="Despina" data-scaytid="111">Despina</span> <span word="Olympiou" data-scaytid="112">Olympiou</span> - Aν <span word="με" data-scaytid="114">με</span> <span word="θυμάσαι" data-scaytid="115">θυμάσαι</span> (English: If You Remember Me)</strong></a></p>
<p><span word="Olympiou" data-scaytid="113">Olympiou</span> has been a professional performer for over two decades now, and has been releasing albums in Cyprus and Greece throughout the <span word="21st" data-scaytid="116">21st</span> Century. <em>Aν <span word="με" data-scaytid="117">με</span> <span word="θυμάσαι" data-scaytid="118">θυμάσαι</span></em> begins with unadorned vocals before gentle, acoustic guitar enters, accompanying shots of <span word="Olympiou" data-scaytid="119">Olympiou</span> looking pensively into a lake. However, that&rsquo;s about as exciting as the track gets, because it just kind of limps along doing nothing in particular until &ndash; obviously &ndash; the key change which doesn&rsquo;t generate any kind of drama or excitement because it doesn&rsquo;t feel fully earned. <em>Aν <span word="με" data-scaytid="123">με</span> <span word="θυμάσαι" data-scaytid="124">θυμάσαι</span></em> has a slight demo feel to it, by which I mean it seems like it&rsquo;s still lacking two or three elements before it can be considered a standalone track in its own right. Mind you, there&rsquo;s hardly a surfeit of cash in Cyprus right now, so perhaps keeping this song as simple as possible is some kind of government-backed austerity measure. <strong>2/12</strong></p>
<p><em>Key change count: 5</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k59E7T0H-Us&amp;list=PLmWYEDTNOGUKfEugVqo6990shcS51Nmfy"><strong>Denmark: <span word="Emmelie" data-scaytid="128">Emmelie</span> De Forest &ndash; Only Teardrops</strong></a></p>
<p>Brilliantly, when introducing herself in the Danish competition to find this year&rsquo;s <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="127">Eurovision</span> entry, De Forest claimed that her great-great-grandmother was Queen Victoria. It&rsquo;s quite an interesting promotional hook, though the claim has had to be dropped after it appears that, despite some royal lineage, De Forest can&rsquo;t quite back it up. <em>Only Teardrops</em> begins with a tin whistle solo, which is enough to make you want to gnaw your own arm off in protest, but it builds to a rousing chorus, replete with military tattoo dreams and decent melodies. Then that <span word="pillock" data-scaytid="130">pillock</span> comes in with a tin whistle again &ndash; seriously, what is his problem? Towards the end, it focuses more on vocal power than anything else, and the song suffers for it, but it appears that&rsquo;s just a consequence of the Simon <span word="Cowell-ruled" data-scaytid="131">Cowell-ruled</span> world that we live in. Apart from the bits where <em>Only Teardrops</em> sounds like a penniless Irish <span word="busker" data-scaytid="132">busker</span>, it&rsquo;s certainly <span word="listenable" data-scaytid="133">listenable</span> though, like one or two other songs on this list, there&rsquo;s clear room for improvement. <strong>6/12</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first ten out of the way. Be sure to check out <a href="singles-bar-eurovision-2013-special-part-two.html">Part 2</a>.</p>
