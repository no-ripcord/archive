  <p>In our most recent podcast, we explored foreign language pop, and why it&#39;s still treated with such suspicion in the English-speaking world. People are missing out by refusing to be more open-minded as this playlist shows. We&#39;ve tracks from around the world, sung in French, Swedish, Afrikaans and more. You can also discover these tracks for yourself, with accompanying playlists available on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/NRFeatures/library/playlists/5zgd0_staff_playlist_%252311%253A_foreign_language_songs"><span word="last.fm" data-scaytid="1">last.fm</span></a>, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/noripcordfeatures/playlist/2ajRQP9npM4y6s9p1RpqQc"><span word="Spotify" data-scaytid="4">Spotify</span></a>, <a href="http://8tracks.com/noripcordfeatures/staff-playlist-11-foreign-language-songs"><span word="8tracks" data-scaytid="5">8tracks</span> </a>and <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Staff+Playlist+number+11+Foreign+Language+Songs/62887337"><span word="Grooveshark" data-scaytid="242">Grooveshark</span></a>. We&#39;d also like to hear your recommendations for foreign language tracks and maybe you could even point us in the direction of some blogs. We&#39;re fans of <a href="http://www.awesometapes.com/">Awesome Tapes From Africa</a> already, let us know what you&#39;re listening to.</p>
<p>NB: Not all tracks are available on all playlists and, while every effort has been made with correct spellings and accents, unfortunately we&#39;re not linguistic experts. Apologies if there are any mistakes in artist names or song titles.</p>
<p><strong>The Very Best - Cape Cod <span word="Kwassa" data-scaytid="7">Kwassa</span> <span word="Kwassa" data-scaytid="8">Kwassa</span></strong></p>
<p>At a gig in Bristol a couple of years back, between sets from the rather dull James <span word="Yuill" data-scaytid="11">Yuill</span> and headliners Zero 7, the venue&#39;s loudspeakers suddenly started playing what I now know to be The Very Best&#39;s version of Vampire Weekend&#39;s <em>Cape Cod <span word="Kwassa" data-scaytid="9">Kwassa</span> <span word="Kwassa" data-scaytid="10">Kwassa</span></em>. The track became an instant <span word="favourite" data-scaytid="12">favourite</span> of mine. Retaining the catchy riff from Vampire Weekend&#39;s original, but with new vocals and production from <span word="Esau" data-scaytid="13">Esau</span> <span word="Mwamwaya" data-scaytid="14">Mwamwaya</span> and <span word="Radioclit" data-scaytid="15">Radioclit</span> (collectively known as The Very Best), this version of <em>Cape Cod...</em> abandons the song&#39;s indie origins in <span word="favour" data-scaytid="16">favour</span> of overtly joyful world music. <em>Craig Stevens</em></p>
<p><strong>France Gall - <span word="Poupée" data-scaytid="17">Poupée</span> de <span word="Cire" data-scaytid="19">Cire</span>, <span word="Poupée" data-scaytid="18">Poupée</span> de Son</strong></p>
<p>In the sixties, even the <span word="Eurovision" data-scaytid="23">Eurovision</span> Song Contest was unbelievably cool, apparently. Certainly no winner during my lifetime has been quite so effortlessly beautiful, memorable, or... well... creepy as <em><span word="Poupée" data-scaytid="20">Poupée</span> de <span word="Cire" data-scaytid="22">Cire</span>, <span word="Poupée" data-scaytid="21">Poupée</span> de Son</em>. Although, as the track was written by bon vivant, <span word="womaniser" data-scaytid="24">womaniser</span>, genius and French national treasure Serge <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="25">Gainsbourg</span>, the fact that a then-teenage Gall is singing about her, and her fans, being puppets of the music industry (and many more things besides &ndash; the double meanings are too extensive to list here) seems less surprising.&nbsp;And, as a side-note, if Arcade Fire had given their frantic run-through of the song the full release that it had deserved then I would have gladly included it in September&#39;s covers playlist, but they didn&#39;t, so I didn&#39;t (but if you haven&#39;t heard it, track it down on YouTube as it&#39;s possibly the best thing they&#39;ve ever done). <em>Mark Davison</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Françoise" data-scaytid="26">Françoise</span> Hardy - La Question</strong></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know French to be touched by this heart-rending song. Hardy&rsquo;s breathy phrasing conveys the hurt and grief of a dying relationship. The arrangement is sparse, just guitar, piano, and delicate violins that wrap around her voice like gossamer. If you haven&rsquo;t heard Hardy before, I know no better introduction. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></p>
<p><strong>Fred <span word="Åkerstöm" data-scaytid="27">Åkerstöm</span> - Jag <span word="Ger" data-scaytid="28">Ger</span> Dig Min <span word="Morgon" data-scaytid="29">Morgon</span></strong></p>
<p>I hadn&#39;t heard this song until my wife starting singing along to a tune that I&#39;d been working on for a little while. I thought I&#39;d written something worthwhile; it turned out I&#39;d somehow learned how to play this song note for note, despite having no conscious knowledge of its existence. <em>Jag <span word="Ger" data-scaytid="30">Ger</span>&nbsp;Dig Min <span word="Morgon" data-scaytid="31">Morgon</span></em> is a cover of Tom Paxton&#39;s <em>I Give You The Morning</em>, but in slowing the tempo and simplifying the melody, <span word="Åkerstöm" data-scaytid="32">Åkerstöm</span> turns a strong composition into something truly spectacular. Even if you don&#39;t understand a word he is saying, you&#39;ll know from his rich and tender vocal that he means every last word. <em>David Coleman</em></p>
<p><strong>Seether - <span word="Kom" data-scaytid="33">Kom</span> <span word="Saam" data-scaytid="34">Saam</span> Met My (Secret Song)</strong></p>
<p>This pick stems purely from the tune&#39;s weirdness. It&#39;s even stranger when you consider that this is a hidden track on what is considered Seether&#39;s (typically known for heavy, angry and scream-powered rock) darkest album. Upon reading the translation, it&#39;s fairly clear that the song was recorded on a whim and succeeds in its ironic poke at the preceding album&#39;s musical weight. It also displays one of the native tongues of lead singer/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist Dale Stewart, both of South Africa. Since when does a dark, quasi-grunge band pump out a short, lighthearted jazz song sung in Afrikaans. That&#39;s pretty wicked. <em><span word="Luredo" data-scaytid="35">Luredo</span> <span word="Marbery" data-scaytid="36">Marbery</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Monade" data-scaytid="37">Monade</span> - <span word="Étoile" data-scaytid="38">Étoile</span></strong></p>
<p><span word="Monade" data-scaytid="39">Monade</span> are the side project of <span word="Laetitia" data-scaytid="41">Laetitia</span> <span word="Sadier" data-scaytid="42">Sadier</span> from <span word="Stereolab" data-scaytid="43">Stereolab</span>&nbsp;and unlike her group of old, they actually write some verse-chorus-verse songs from time to time. They&#39;re less concerned with <span word="analogue" data-scaytid="44">analogue</span>&nbsp;<span word="bloops" data-scaytid="45">bloops</span> and bleeps, and occasionally make gorgeous records like <em><span word="Étoile" data-scaytid="40">Étoile</span> </em>(French for &quot;star&quot;). It&#39;s a woozy, dreamy track that falls from phrase to phrase and - excuse my rudimentary and ever-dwindling knowledge of the French language - seems to be about a woman&#39;s gradual descent into madness. There&#39;s a hint of <span word="60s" data-scaytid="46">60s</span> <span word="Parisien" data-scaytid="47">Parisien</span> <span word="glamour" data-scaytid="48">glamour</span> throughout as strings rise and swoop, and the triplets towards the end of each verse are astonishingly effective. Lovely, immersive stuff. <em>Joe Rivers</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Vapnet" data-scaytid="49">Vapnet</span> - <span word="Thoméegränd" data-scaytid="50">Thoméegränd</span></strong></p>
<p>A number of Swedish artists have perfected this particular brand of melancholic jangle-pop song, but few are bold enough to use their first language to tell their tales of social awkwardness and unrequited love. On this sublime offering, <span word="Östersund&#039;s" data-scaytid="52">Östersund&#39;s</span> <span word="Vapnet" data-scaytid="51">Vapnet</span> (which means &quot;the weapon&quot;) prove that language really is no barrier when you have melody and emotion on your side. <em>David Coleman</em></p>
<p><strong>Jorge Ben &ndash; <span word="Bebete" data-scaytid="53">Bebete</span> <span word="Vãobora" data-scaytid="54">Vãobora</span></strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Jorge Ben, it can be hard to know where to start and his immense back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="57">catalogue</span> can be intimidating. You could do worse than to begin with his self-titled album from 1969, his sixth and I believe his best. Arguably one of Brazil&rsquo;s greatest exports, he has become renowned as an alchemist of funk, soul and samba, and demonstrates this so well in <em><span word="Bebete" data-scaytid="55">Bebete</span> <span word="Vãobora" data-scaytid="56">Vãobora</span></em>. It&rsquo;s <span word="trippy" data-scaytid="58">trippy</span>, yet catchy and you can enjoy Ben&rsquo;s incredible vocals without knowing what they mean. The perfect marriage of trumpets and his experimental guitar transport you to Brasilia and still manage to sound fresh after forty years. <em><span word="Natassia" data-scaytid="59">Natassia</span> <span word="Caffery" data-scaytid="60">Caffery</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Shugo" data-scaytid="61">Shugo</span> <span word="Tokumaru" data-scaytid="62">Tokumaru</span> - Rum <span word="Hee" data-scaytid="63">Hee</span> (<span word="Deerhoof" data-scaytid="64">Deerhoof</span> Remix)</strong></p>
<p>Tokyo-born singer-songwriter <span word="Shugo" data-scaytid="65">Shugo</span> <span word="Tokumaru" data-scaytid="66">Tokumaru</span> is well known in his native Japan, both for his solo work and as one-fifth of Japanese rock band <span word="Gellers" data-scaytid="68">Gellers</span>. Outside of Japan, his music is known by few but, as the incredible rise of <span word="Souterrain" data-scaytid="69">Souterrain</span> Transmissions <span word="labelmates" data-scaytid="70">labelmates</span> <span word="EMA" data-scaytid="71">EMA</span> and <span word="Zola" data-scaytid="72">Zola</span> Jesus in recent months proves, that could easily change. Taken from his 2009 EP of the same name, <em>Rum </em><span word="Hee&#039;s" data-scaytid="73"><em>Hee</em>&#39;s</span> uplifting sound, mishmash of rhythms and complex instrumentation openly invites comparisons to <span word="Sigur" data-scaytid="74">Sigur</span> <span word="Ros" data-scaytid="75">Ros</span> or <span word="Sufjan" data-scaytid="76">Sufjan</span> Stevens. This remix by Californian group <span word="Deerhoof" data-scaytid="67">Deerhoof</span> adds another level of bouncy happiness to a song that&#39;s already joyously upbeat. <em>Craig Stevens</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Émilie" data-scaytid="77">Émilie</span> Simon &ndash; Opium</strong></p>
<p>Trip-hop producer/singer <span word="Émilie" data-scaytid="78">Émilie</span> Simon somehow never really found an audience outside of France, which I can only attribute to the language barrier. But I actually find it makes <em>Opium </em>all the more intriguing &ndash; with my limited <span word="GCSE-level" data-scaytid="79">GCSE-level</span> French I can only barely get a grip on what the song is about, but the language suits Simon&rsquo;s delicate vocals and beats perfectly. This is a gorgeous piece of twinkly, atmospheric pop. <em>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="80">Wragg</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Mina - Se <span word="Telefonando" data-scaytid="81">Telefonando</span></strong></p>
<p>Written by <span word="Ennio" data-scaytid="82">Ennio</span> <span word="Morricone" data-scaytid="83">Morricone</span>, this huge 1966 hit for Italian pop diva Mina <span word="Mazzini" data-scaytid="84">Mazzini</span> was inspired by police sirens. Everything about it is clever, even its lyrics about a woman hesitant to continue a budding relationship. The song has two movements: the first a slow introduction with baroque trumpets, the second a faster tempo with full orchestra, the chromatic scale ascending as the same musical phrase is repeated, building to a crescendo of drums and sawing violins. It&rsquo;s a perfect showcase for Mina&rsquo;s three-octave vocal range. Bravo, maestro! <em>Angel Aguilar</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Azumi" data-scaytid="85">Azumi</span> Inoue/Joe <span word="Hisaishi" data-scaytid="86">Hisaishi</span> &ndash; <span word="Kimi" data-scaytid="87">Kimi</span>&nbsp;<span word="Wo" data-scaytid="88">Wo</span> <span word="Nosete" data-scaytid="89">Nosete</span></strong></p>
<p>The ongoing marriage of Japanese anime master <span word="Hayao" data-scaytid="93">Hayao</span> <span word="Miyazaki&#039;s" data-scaytid="94">Miyazaki&#39;s</span> films with the music of Joe <span word="Hisaishi" data-scaytid="90">Hisaishi</span> seems like a perfect fit; both men use very traditional, simple techniques and components to magical effect. Perhaps this is the greatest thing that the partnership has produced so far - the theme song to their second film together, 1986&#39;s <strong><span word="Laputa" data-scaytid="95">Laputa</span> AKA Castle in the Sky</strong>, sung by <span word="Azumi" data-scaytid="91">Azumi</span> Inoue (who might be something of a <span word="Ghibli" data-scaytid="96">Ghibli</span> lucky-charm, having also provided vocals for <em>My <span word="Neighbour" data-scaytid="98">Neighbour</span> <span word="Totoro" data-scaytid="99">Totoro</span></em> and <em>Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service</em>). Somehow managing to be big and enchanting, delicate and heartfelt all at once, I&#39;d say that it manages to invoke a sense of child-like wonder, even when you don&#39;t understand the language (and when it&#39;s being listened to away from the source film). Quite why Inoue thought it was a good idea to include a syrupy reworking of the song on her recent <span word="Ghibli" data-scaytid="97">Ghibli</span> tribute album (which is unfortunately the only version of the song that <span word="Spotify" data-scaytid="92">Spotify</span> are offering) I have no idea. <em>Mark Davison</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Os" data-scaytid="100">Os</span> <span word="Mutantes" data-scaytid="101">Mutantes</span> &ndash; <span word="Panis" data-scaytid="102">Panis</span> et <span word="Circenses" data-scaytid="103">Circenses</span></strong></p>
<p>During a brief obsession with the weird and wonderful Elephant 6 collective, I ended up discovering this Brazilian psych-pop band who preceded the likes of the Olivia Tremor Control and Of Montreal by about 30 years. Like Elephant 6, it&rsquo;s full of jubilant horns and tambourine, and one of the catchiest tunes I&rsquo;ve ever heard. <em><span word="Panis" data-scaytid="104">Panis</span> et <span word="Circenses" data-scaytid="105">Circenses</span></em> breaks down midway through for a wacky <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="107">lo-fi</span> interlude, before a brilliant crescendo, and it ends with what sounds like the band eating in a restaurant. I still can&rsquo;t quite believe it was made in 1968. <em>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="106">Wragg</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Superaquello" data-scaytid="108">Superaquello</span> - El <span word="Pelo" data-scaytid="109">Pelo</span> de <span word="Dios" data-scaytid="110">Dios</span></strong></p>
<p>In the last decade, Puerto Rico&rsquo;s best-kept secret tenaciously fought to stay afloat with little or no commercial success. Over their thirteen-year-old run, <span word="Superaquello" data-scaytid="111">Superaquello</span> strictly followed their own inclinations, crafting four exceedingly inventive albums that would&rsquo;ve caused a commotion in <span word="tastemaker" data-scaytid="114">tastemaker</span> blogs had they succumbed to singing outside of their native Spanish. <em>El <span word="Pelo" data-scaytid="112">Pelo</span> de <span word="Dios" data-scaytid="113">Dios</span></em> exemplifies their panache for merging electronic modulations with traditional folklore, largely due to main songwriter Francs Perez&rsquo;s mishmash of four-string <span word="cuatro" data-scaytid="115">cuatro</span> compositions and Jorge Castro&rsquo;s liquefied, 60 <span word="bpm" data-scaytid="116">bpm</span> electronic pulses. Patricia Vargas&rsquo; hushed, sugary vocals were always the gateway for them to instill their <span word="synth" data-scaytid="117">synth</span> pop roots, but the band&rsquo;s multi-layered arrangements provided the luscious songs a pop patina that defies any blinkered concept of what Latino music should sound like. <em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="118">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez</em></p>
<p><strong>Serge <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="119">Gainsbourg</span> - Comic Strip</strong></p>
<p>I thought this song was pretty bizarre but then I saw the <span word="biopic" data-scaytid="124">biopic</span>, <strong><span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="120">Gainsbourg</span></strong>, and now I think it&#39;s even stranger. In the film, the song is written as notorious <span word="crumpeteer" data-scaytid="125">crumpeteer</span> <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="121">Gainsbourg</span> is <span word="persauding" data-scaytid="126">persauding</span>&nbsp;paramour, Brigitte <span word="Bardot" data-scaytid="127">Bardot</span>, that she could be a superhero. That goes some way to explain <span word="Bardot&#039;s" data-scaytid="128">Bardot&#39;s</span> exclamations of <em>&quot;<span word="Kapow" data-scaytid="130">Kapow</span>!&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;<span word="Whizz" data-scaytid="131">Whizz</span>!&quot;</em> but it still has the mark of a vanity project that wouldn&#39;t normally make it to a full album. However, this is from <span word="Gainsbourg&#039;s" data-scaytid="132">Gainsbourg&#39;s</span> <strong>Initials <span word="B.B" data-scaytid="123">B.B</span>.</strong> LP, recorded at a time when France&#39;s first couple were in the initial throes of their passionate affair. It&#39;s not a great track in the classic sense, but it&#39;s absolutely charming to hear two people in love abandon any notion of cool and just have fun recording in a studio. They&#39;re having a whale of a time; <span word="Bardot&#039;s" data-scaytid="129">Bardot&#39;s</span>&nbsp;squeals get ever more excited and, if you listen carefully, <span word="Gainsbourg" data-scaytid="122">Gainsbourg</span> emits a sly chuckle towards the end as he sings, <em>&quot;<span word="n&#039;ait" data-scaytid="134">n&#39;ait</span> pas <span word="peur" data-scaytid="135">peur</span>&quot;</em>. Despite <span word="Gainsbourg&#039;s" data-scaytid="133">Gainsbourg&#39;s</span>&nbsp;reputation as a <span word="Gitanes-chewing" data-scaytid="136">Gitanes-chewing</span>, sex-obsessed poet, this is a reminder of more innocent times. <em>Joe Rivers</em></p>
<p><strong>Gipsy Kings - Hotel California</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s start this off with me completely acknowledging that I am only turned on to this song because of <strong>The Big <span word="Lebowski" data-scaytid="139">Lebowski</span></strong>. But, c&#39;mon, once it hits you during the film you can&#39;t help but think, &quot;I&#39;d much rather listen to this than The Eagles&#39; version.&quot; I mean, what&#39;s so much better about the original? Other than comprehension, that is. After getting over the thought of Jesus <span word="Quintana" data-scaytid="140">Quintana</span> (&quot;Eight-year-olds, Dude.&quot;) sexually bowling, one can realize the song&#39;s actually an original and good goddamn cover. It adds Americana rhythm and classical Spanish guitar with lyrics sung completely in <span word="Español" data-scaytid="141">Español</span> by a guy who sounds like a traditionally handsome Mexican soap opera actor from the &#39;90s.
