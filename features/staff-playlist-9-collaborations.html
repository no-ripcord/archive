  <p>Now that we&#39;ve run out of complete decades to make playlists out of, we&#39;re having the engage our brains a bit more. This month we&#39;re looking at collaborations and the magical moments where great artists come together to make something even better than the sum of their parts. This isn&#39;t mean to be a definitive list of the best ever alliances, they&#39;re just tracks that we love. We&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on our choices and even for you to make a selection or two of your own, get in contact using the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="4">Disqus</span> form at the bottom of the page or via <a href="https://www.twitter.com/noripcord">Twitter</a>. That way, this playlist can be a collaboration between us and you - do you see what we did there?</p>
<p>As always, you&#39;ve got the ability to listen to the playlist too, so check it out on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/NRFeatures/library/playlists/58jbn_staff_playlist_%25239%253A_collaborations"><span word="last.fm" data-scaytid="1">last.fm</span></a>, <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Staff+Playlist+number+9+Collaborations/57858348"><span word="Grooveshark" data-scaytid="5">Grooveshark</span></a>, <a href="http://8tracks.com/noripcordfeatures/staff-playlist-9-collaborations"><span word="8tracks" data-scaytid="6">8tracks</span> </a>or <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/noripcordfeatures/playlist/3ULnv0r9ctwZkdfEEePcRS"><span word="Spotify" data-scaytid="7">Spotify</span> </a>(now available in the US of A). Above all, enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Sonic Youth - Death Valley &#39;69</strong></p>
<p>Arguably, this was where the band found their identity and it&#39;s one of the essential parts of their back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="8">catalogue</span> (it was my point of entry into the band, and it was pretty much love at first listen). Yet it&#39;s actually the presence of performance poet Lydia Lunch that makes it what it is &ndash; Kim Gordon may be a bona fide alternative rock icon, but she&#39;s always been too cool and collected to turn in a performance as terrifyingly unhinged as Lunch does here. <em>Mark Davison</em></p>
<p><strong>Louis Armstrong - Summer Time (with Ella Fitzgerald)</strong></p>
<p>As duets go, <em>Summer Time</em> by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald is an amazing listen. Armstrong&rsquo;s <span word="bluesy" data-scaytid="9">bluesy</span> trumpet and Fitzgerald&rsquo;s unmatched inflections exude&nbsp;honesty, passion and incredible ability. Modern day soul, neo-blues and R&amp;B don&rsquo;t&nbsp;some close to the power of these two, which doesn&rsquo;t only enhance its beauty, but&nbsp;remarks heavily on what little we expect from popular music these days. <em>Sean Caldwell</em></p>
<p><strong>Crystal Castles - Not In Love (feat. Robert Smith)</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s a case to be made for this track being far more symbolic than simply a meeting of minds; it&#39;s a passing of the baton. Few bands embody the original spirit of The Cure like Crystal Castles and, fittingly, <em>Not In Love</em> is the best thing Crystal Castles have put their name to as well as being the greatest track Smith&#39;s featured on for well over a decade. <em>Not In Love</em> is a pop song in spirit (Crystal Castles could do with more of this sort of focus elsewhere) but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be thrilling and abrasive. As the bridge hurtles towards the chorus, the tension rises before being released in an explosion of pure, cathartic noise. Sublime. <em>Joe Rivers</em></p>
<p><strong>Heavenly - C Is The Heavenly Option</strong></p>
<p>By the early &lsquo;90s, <span word="twee" data-scaytid="10">twee</span> pop was beginning to lapse into self-parody, as the genre&rsquo;s more ridiculous aspects got the better of it. This duet is a transatlantic partnership of two <span word="twee" data-scaytid="11">twee</span> pop pioneers: Heavenly singer Amelia Fletcher (formerly of <span word="Talulah" data-scaytid="13">Talulah</span> Gosh) and Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, founder of K Records; Fletcher&rsquo;s sickly-sweet croon versus Johnson&rsquo;s deep, out-of-tune croak. Their call and response narrates a magazine multiple-choice personality quiz, with a pseudo-rap breakdown by Fletcher (while Johnson makes disturbing gurgling noises). It&rsquo;s deeply quirky, but catchy nonetheless, and fittingly, these layers of silliness mask the quintessentially <span word="twee" data-scaytid="12">twee</span> theme of emotional immaturity. <em>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="14">Wragg</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Nancy Sinatra and Lee <span word="Hazlewood" data-scaytid="16">Hazlewood</span> - Some Velvet Morning</strong></p>
<p>If you ever wondered where the recent Cat&rsquo;s Eyes project took its inspiration from, look no further than the classic brawn/<span word="glamour" data-scaytid="18">glamour</span> pairing between Nancy Sinatra and Lee <span word="Hazlewood" data-scaytid="17">Hazlewood</span>. Straight out of some altered universe, <em>Some Velvet Morning</em> was eerily psychedelic &ndash; a nugget of sixties chamber pop that enmeshed Sinatra&rsquo;s quintessentially tender voice with <span word="Hazlewood’s" data-scaytid="19">Hazlewood&rsquo;s</span> lascivious braggadocio to create an arousing splendor of sight and sound. Her heavenly segments, which drift with flower power imagery, sharply transition with <span word="Hazlewood’s" data-scaytid="20">Hazlewood&rsquo;s</span> barren purgatory like a hazy late-afternoon daydream. It needn&#39;t be explained. One of the oddest songs to ever grace the Billboard charts, its elusive mythological allusions on the meaning of love continue to mesmerize as much as befuddle. <em>Juan <span word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="21">Edgardo</span>&nbsp;Rodriguez</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Os" data-scaytid="54">Os</span> <span word="Mutantes" data-scaytid="58">Mutantes</span> - A <span word="Minha" data-scaytid="61">Minha</span> <span word="Menina" data-scaytid="181">Menina</span></strong></p>
<p>The vibrant <span word="Tropicália" data-scaytid="122">Tropicália</span> movement that emerged in late <span word="1960s" data-scaytid="126">1960s</span> Brazil celebrated the art of collaboration. For many, the definitive album of the era is itself a collaborative project - <strong><span word="Tropicália" data-scaytid="123">Tropicália</span>: <span word="ou" data-scaytid="127">ou</span> <span word="Panis" data-scaytid="128">Panis</span> et <span word="Circencis" data-scaytid="156">Circencis</span></strong> - which features most of the scene&#39;s key players, either <span word="duetting" data-scaytid="130">duetting</span> or performing each other&#39;s compositions. This wonderful song isn&#39;t on the <strong><span word="Tropicália" data-scaytid="124">Tropicália</span> </strong>album, but it is a collaboration - Jorge Ben, who actually wrote it, contributes vocals and acoustic guitar to the recording. As well as being a cracking summer tune, this also provides a great starting point for those new to the <span word="Tropicália" data-scaytid="152">Tropicália</span> movement. <em>David Coleman</em></p>
<p><strong>Manic Street Preachers - Your Love Alone Is Not Enough</strong></p>
<p>The Manics&#39; crunchy chords fit perfectly with the sexy vocals of The Cardigan&#39;s Nina <span word="Persson" data-scaytid="22">Persson</span>. The song is about regret, recrimination, and - judging by the YouTube&nbsp;video - looking good in high boots. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></p>
<p><strong>Atlas Sound - Walkabout (with Noah Lennox)</strong></p>
<p>Bradford Cox (Atlas Sound) and Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) have a lot in common. They&rsquo;re both the most <span word="recognisable" data-scaytid="23">recognisable</span> members of their respective experimental indie-rock groups, <span word="Deerhunter" data-scaytid="24">Deerhunter</span> and Animal Collective, both of whom have won rave reviews for their idiosyncratic slants on the genre. It&rsquo;s an alt-rock wet dream of a collaboration, as Lennox&rsquo;s sampling expertise meets Cox&rsquo;s ethereal harmonies. Their two starkly non-traditional approaches to music are each completely discernible, but it&rsquo;s deceptively simple - a wide-eyed and glorious musical moment from a partnership that seems so natural, I only hope they&rsquo;ll meet up again soon. <em>Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="15">Wragg</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Queen and David Bowie - Under Pressure</strong></p>
<p>The teaming of David Bowie and Queen saw two legendary British artists at the height of their popularity - Bowie had just released arguably his finest work in <strong>Scary Monsters</strong>, and Queen their first American number one album <strong>The Game</strong> - join forces and release one of the very best rock collaborations in recorded history; the majestic <em>Under Pressure</em>. Oscillating between ethereal atmospherics, finger-snapping funk and otherworldly histrionics, you might want to check your pulse if you&#39;re not moved by the sonic sophistication and sheer power of this track. Written essentially by Freddie Mercury (although John Deacon reportedly came up with the <span word="bassline" data-scaytid="25">bassline</span>), it&#39;s both intimate and incredibly grand, and sadly was the last golden moment for either artist. Queen would go on to include this on their career nadir <strong>Hot Space</strong> (as well as rightfully on their <strong>Greatest Hits</strong> collection), while Bowie would succumb to the steep artistic downward spiral of the <span word="80s" data-scaytid="26">80s</span>, beginning with the slick <strong>Let&#39;s Dance</strong>. <em>Pierce Brown</em></p>
<p><strong>Patrick Wolf - The Bachelor</strong></p>
<p>Wolf&#39;s album of the same name boasted an impressive line-up of guests who, in keeping with the rest of the record, pretty much botched things up (not that it was really their fault &ndash; and Alec Empire did some good work on <em>Vulture</em>... and then completely undid it with his co-write on the excruciating <em>Battle</em>). This duet with folk royalty Eliza <span word="Carthy" data-scaytid="27">Carthy</span> was the exception, a fairly straight take on a traditional ballad where Wolf&#39;s chocolate-rich voice and <span word="Carthy&#039;s" data-scaytid="28">Carthy&#39;s</span> gravelly croak simultaneously fought against and entwined themselves around each other, resulting in something rather special. <em>Mark Davison</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill Wells and Aidan Moffat - The Copper Top</strong></p>
<p>While this is by no means a classic or long established collaboration - its parents record is barely months old - it is however worthy of genuine mention. It&#39;s a song that embodies and bitterly embraces the harsh reality of maturity and mortality. Bill Wells&#39; piano keys, the principle and <span word="sombre" data-scaytid="29">sombre</span> melody and rhythm that strike hard yet sweetly throughout. Aidan Moffat&#39;s pub-situated <span word="monologue" data-scaytid="30">monologue</span> is essentially an anti-funeral speech as he mourns a loved one away from the rest of the service attendees - <em>&quot;Birth, love and death; the only reasons to get dressed up&quot;</em>. Capturing that lyrical disparity that belongs to somebody else is a demanding task, but in this case Wells has not only succeeded but somehow added a further element of <span word="candour" data-scaytid="31">candour</span>. <em>Daniel Dylan Wray</em></p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Man - Getting Nowhere (feat. John Legend)</strong></p>
<p>Despite not reaching the Top 40 on its release as a single in the UK earlier in 2011, <em>Getting Nowhere</em> is, without question, one of the standout tracks from Magnetic Man&#39;s excellent self-titled <span word="début" data-scaytid="32">début</span>. Growing from a gentle percussive opening, the soft <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="33">dubstep</span> beat and the silky vocals of the hugely talented John Legend compliment each other perfectly to create a track full of soul and passion; a song that&#39;s as equally powerful in a club environment as it is beautiful to listen to as part of the album. <em>Craig Stevens</em></p>
<p><strong>M Ward - Oh Lonesome Me</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people think this is a Neil Young composition, but the song was actually written and performed in a surprisingly jaunty fashion by country singer Don Gibson in 1958. 51 years later, M Ward recorded what is arguably the definitive version of <em>Oh Lonesome Me</em> with Lucinda <span word="WIlliams" data-scaytid="226">WIlliams</span> for his <strong>Hold Time</strong> album. Ward contributes a rich lead vocal and some gorgeous <span word="minimalistic" data-scaytid="225">minimalistic</span> guitar patterns, but the gravelly voiced Williams steals the show with a performance that truly captures the raw emotion of the song&#39;s lyrics. <em>David Coleman</em></p>
<p><strong>Brian <span word="Eno" data-scaytid="158">Eno</span> and David Byrne - America Is Waiting</strong></p>
<p>There is a sense of militaristic and systematic anxiety within the marched rhythm&nbsp;and sampled editorializing in <em>America Is Waiting</em>, the first track from Brian <span word="Eno" data-scaytid="35">Eno</span> and&nbsp;David Byrne&rsquo;s electronic and sample pioneering <strong>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</strong>.&nbsp;Released in 1981, the song takes televised and argumentative commentary as its&nbsp;main vocal (<em>&ldquo;America is waiting for a message of some sort of <span word="another...”" data-scaytid="2">another...&rdquo;</span></em>), expressing&nbsp;dissatisfaction with government and citizens while the industrial churn persists, exposing&nbsp;flaws in the system&rsquo;s works while generating an intense feeling of paranoia. Thirty years&nbsp;later, <em>America Is Waiting</em> somehow seems very appropriate, our current economic and&nbsp;political systems in turmoil as America watches every detail and waits for a miracle. <em>Sean Caldwell</em></p>
<p><strong><span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="36">Kanye</span> West - Monster (feat. Jay-Z, Rick Ross, <span word="Nicki" data-scaytid="38">Nicki</span> <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="39">Minaj</span> and Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="41">Iver</span>)</strong></p>
<p>You may have observed that <span word="Kanye&#039;s" data-scaytid="44">Kanye&#39;s</span> rather fond of collaborations, but this one&#39;s slightly different. While most of his work relies on him being the <span word="centre" data-scaytid="45">centre</span> of attention (especially on the album from which this track is taken, <strong>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong>), he takes a backseat here and lets the impressive array of <span word="MCs" data-scaytid="46">MCs</span> showcase their skills (well, except Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="42">Iver</span>, obviously). The result is wonderfully pure. The beats are simple, the groove is subtly addictive and each guest turn better than the last. After <span word="Kanye" data-scaytid="37">Kanye</span> and Rick Ross, we&#39;re treated to a desperate, paranoid Jay-Z before an incredible verse from <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="40">Minaj</span>. She really proves she&#39;s <em>&quot;hotter than a middle Eastern climate,&quot;</em> with her mixing of moods, rhymes and voices - she ranges from babyish, cutesy gurgles to possessed, demonic growl. You&#39;ll certainly believe her when she screams, <em>&quot;I&#39;m a <span word="motherfucking" data-scaytid="47">motherfucking</span>&nbsp;MONSTER!&quot;</em> Better than anything else on <strong>...Fantasy</strong>, not to mention <span word="Minaj&#039;s" data-scaytid="48">Minaj&#39;s</span> <strong>Pink Friday</strong> - <em>Monster </em>is the sound of hip-hop&#39;s biggest names at the top of their game (oh, and Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="43">Iver</span>). <em>Joe Rivers</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds - Where The Wild Roses Grow (feat. Kylie Minogue)</strong></p>
<p>One would think this Aussie pairing would be as savory as peaches and&nbsp;<span word="Vegemite" data-scaytid="49">Vegemite</span>, but Minogue comes through and acquits herself very well around Cave&#39;s gruff voice. The song is about a courtship gone awry, sung from the point&nbsp;of view of the killer and his victim. If you&rsquo;re in the mood for a murder ballad, grab&nbsp;a stiff drink and listen to this. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></p>
<p>Sitting chronologically between a string of pure pop chart hits in the late <span word="1980s" data-scaytid="50">1980s</span> and electro-based tracks in the <span word="2000s" data-scaytid="51">2000s</span>, <em>Where the Wild Roses Grow</em> is one of a string of interesting, more alternative songs to feature Kylie Minogue in the <span word="mid-1990s" data-scaytid="52">mid-1990s</span>.&nbsp;Written by, and sung as a duet with Nick Cave, the song tells of the murder of a young girl from both the viewpoint of her obsessive killer and the ghost of the victim. A daring collaboration from the perspective of both parties, <em>Where the Wild Roses Grow</em> is beautiful and haunting in equal measure and remains as wonderfully emotive today as it did on its release. <em>Craig Stevens</em></p>
<p>Is there a more unlikely collaboration in musical history? Nick Cave: heroin addict, alcoholic, founder of one of the most visceral, terrifying and ground breaking bands to have emerged in the 1970&#39;s post-punk scene. Kylie Minogue: star of the trite Australian soap opera <span word="Neighbours" data-scaytid="53">Neighbours</span> and singer of <em>I Should Be So Lucky</em>. The award winning song remains the Bad Seeds&#39; greatest hit to this day. Whilst people&#39;s reasoning for buying said single is questionable, the quality of said single is irrefutable. Kylie (yes, Kylie) succeeds in creating a sincere and touching emotive power as she purrs her tale of murder. Cave, malevolent as ever, is the perfect baritone accompaniment to Kylie&#39;s delicate whisper as they collectively form one of the most bizarre yet strangely touching concoctions to exist in contemporary music. &nbsp;<em>Daniel Dylan Wray</em></p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls - what do you think?</p>
