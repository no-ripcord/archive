  <p>I got to the venue early, maybe about 45 minutes before the doors were supposed to be opened, and took a seat on the steps of the First Unitarian Church.&nbsp; Sound check was pouring out into the streets, Sunn O))) and Eagle Twin basically offering a preview of what would be heard later, and inadvertently reminding me that I forgot to pick up ear plugs.&nbsp; This was going to hurt.<br />
<br />
As rugged, pulsating low end and vocalist Attila Csihar&rsquo;s devilish throat haunted 21st and Chestnut, casual passersby were stopping with uneasy curiosity and taking careful ganders at the set-up inside the church.&nbsp; One exceptionally suburban clad couple stopped and exchanged glances while Csihar was mid-grunt.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;It sounds like &lsquo;</i><b>The Exorcist</b><i>,&rsquo;&rdquo;</i> spoke the female counterpart before the both of them continued their leisurely stroll and left us early concertgoers to loiter in a haze of amplification.<br />
<br />
As sun set, sound check continued.&nbsp; And, continued.&nbsp; And, continued.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
More and more people arrived, an odd mix of traditional metalheads, long beards, black designer hoodies and characters pulled directly from any Daniel Clowes novel.&nbsp; An array of chemical influence was in effect, whether inhaled or imbibed.&nbsp; Everyone just played up their respective attempts at intimidation, smoking cigarettes and looking unapproachable.&nbsp; Kids are so cute.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I was admittedly growing impatient, overhearing bad conversations and the perpetual noise emanating from the Church.<br />
<br />
It was almost 9PM by the time we were let in.<br />
<br />
Before the show even started, the hall was hazy with smoke.&nbsp; After spending $5 on a silkscreened poster, I secured a spot at the end of a pew thinking I had a good vantage point.&nbsp; I was about two or three rows up from the back, but I could see the stage clear as day.<br />
<br />
The altar was stacked tall with giant amps and gothic candelabras were attached to every other pew.&nbsp; It was obvious the ceremonial atmosphere automatically provided by any church was going to be played up for the festivities, the venue&rsquo;s employees walking back and forth in monkish hoods, associating themselves with the headlining act.<br />
<br />
Eagle Twin, a duo comprised of metal guitarist Gentry Densley and drummer Tyler Smith, burn with an energy that some full bands can&rsquo;t muster.&nbsp; An aggressive sludge with slow moving calamitous clangor setting the pace, Eagle Twin played a nonstop block of music for 45 minutes, most of their audience happy to nod in place while a couple people did physically respond in thrash-worthy gesticulations.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes elapsed between bands with some tuning required and push button confirmation that the smoke machine was operable.&nbsp; At this point I didn&rsquo;t think the smoke would obscure THAT much of the show, but twenty minutes into Sunn O)))&rsquo;s set, I realized that my seat sucked:&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see anything.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Initially, while watching the few shutterbugs at the show scampering around the foot of the altar for decent shots of the band, I&rsquo;d felt that flash photography might rob the band of its mystique.&nbsp; But, the strobe effect the camera&rsquo;s employed led to second-long visions of the band in their hoods, momentarily breaking them out from underneath the walls of smoke that had built up around them.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Disappointingly resigned to view nothing, I sort of sank into the reverberating maelstrom the band generated, as did everyone else around me.<br />
<br />
After the venue&rsquo;s gimmicky monks lit each candle in succession, there was a steady hum from the amplifiers before organ music began to sound, building up drama until flawlessly transitioning into roaring movements of guitar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cacophony&rdquo; is an understatement, as is &ldquo;technical proficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can think of no band so amazingly talented at producing this level of noise in such an artistic and composed manner.&nbsp; I dub thee, <i>Decibel Metal</i>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
That being said, it wasn&rsquo;t the easiest show to sit through.&nbsp; Greg Anderson and Stephen O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s signature metallic crescendos are unmet by anything rhythmic for extended periods of time, blistering shrieks of high-amp&rsquo;d guitar and bass living to drone, Csihar&rsquo;s chilling and intense delivery&hellip; I think I heard four songs in almost two hours, and there was nothing you could move to.&nbsp; All you could do was drown in it, like Gregorian chant set to a thunderstorm.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
But, as an experience, Sunn O))) is something to behold.&nbsp; When the candles had been extinguished and the lights had come on, the one word universally spoken around me was <i>&ldquo;intense.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp; I picked up a t-shirt and headed to my car.<br />
<br />
As jazz musician Cecil Taylor once famously stated that his preparation for a concert should be met with the same efforts from his audience, it&rsquo;s obvious that Sunn O))) live by a similar mantra.&nbsp; Well, that and <i>&ldquo;Maximum volume yields maximum results.&rdquo;</i></p>
