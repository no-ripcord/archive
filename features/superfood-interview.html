  <p><img alt="" src="../files/user344/SF.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></p><p>Dom Ganderton and Ryan Malcolm of Superfood are sitting top-deck aboard Bristol&#39;s famous Thekla - once a working cargo ship, now one of the city&#39;s best music venues (maybe even the best, certainly the only one adorned with a Banksy).</p><p>Tonight&#39;s gig, with new Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and King Nun, is the band&#39;s thirteenth show in just 14 days. &nbsp;It&#39;s a tour to showcase and celebrate each of the three new signings to the Dirty Hit record label - a label co-founded by the ex-England football player&nbsp;Ugo Ehiogu, who tragically died of a suspected cardiac arrest last week.</p><p>Dirty Hit are spreading the word of their new recruits with an intensely packed tour covering the breadth and depth of the UK and Ireland. &nbsp;Dom and Ryan appear excited, as they confirm how much they are enjoying being back on the road:</p><p><em>It&rsquo;s been great to start touring again. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a shock to the system, jumping in a van and sharing a room with three different people every night. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been great, though. &nbsp;Everyone&rsquo;s in the same mindset. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve all just signed to this label and we&rsquo;re all out to prove something, to do ourselves proud. &nbsp;And I think because it&rsquo;s billed as a Dirty Hit tour, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like we&rsquo;re headlining as such. &nbsp;Everyone&rsquo;s literally in the same boat!</em></p><p>The tour represents the first live dates in a while for Superfood, a band that released their debut album <strong>Don&#39;t Say That</strong> back in 2014. &nbsp;The only track to be released to fans so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QeaF9pQudo"><em>Double Dutch</em></a>, points to a very different direction from their debut.</p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304524276&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe></p><p><em>All the newer songs have more of a groove to them, they&rsquo;re a bit more &ldquo;in the pocket&rdquo;. &nbsp;But live, we&rsquo;ve adapted the older songs to that kind of feel too. &nbsp;Obviously, they don&rsquo;t sound a million miles away from the originals but we&rsquo;re playing them &ldquo;as&rdquo; the band that has written the new album, we&rsquo;re not just going out and doing what we did the first time. &nbsp;There are a few surprises in there as well. &nbsp;</em><em>Naturally, as well, with a new line-up - a new drummer and bass player - it does gel even though the genres are quite different because they&rsquo;re played with the same band.</em></p><p><em>I think what we set out to do this time was to make an album that we really backed and could listen to for years to come. &nbsp;When we did the first album, we weren&rsquo;t drawing directly on our influences and also, we got a bit carried away. &nbsp;When we started, we wanted to make something that was inspired by Beck, Gorillaz, more like processed beats in our bedroom. &nbsp;And then when we got a band around us, we decided to get in the studio for two weeks and thrash something out, all of us in a room together, we lost sight of that. &nbsp;So when we came to record this album, we decided to set out to do what we wanted to do originally. &nbsp;We decided to spend some time, not fall into the trap of just being another indie band.</em></p><p><em>Also, we had way more time to work on this than we did on our first one. &nbsp;Our first album, we just banged it out really. &nbsp;And on this one, we had eighteen months writing and just got in the swing of it.</em></p><p><em>I think we&rsquo;re going to put another two singles out before the album gets a release. &nbsp;And maybe do some videos. &nbsp;We really want to nail it with the video for the next single. &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t do one for Double Dutch because it was more of a taster.</em></p><p>A few weeks after releasing <em>Double Dutch</em>, the band released an alternative version of the track, entitled <em>Double Dutch (Dubble Dutch)</em>:</p><p><em>The label asked us to do a spin on it, if we could. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t been created until they asked us to do it. &nbsp;We were looking at asking people to remix it and then we decided we could have a go at doing it ourselves. We got in a studio for a day, went in and that&rsquo;s what came out.</em></p><p><em>It was quite easy, it was fun. &nbsp;Whenever you get a remix through, you press play with your eyes closed, wondering what they&rsquo;ve done to it. &nbsp;But we had a clear picture of what we wanted to achieve. &nbsp;We wanted to make it a bit more spacey.</em></p><p><em>We&#39;d love to do more remixes. &nbsp;With the first album, I don&rsquo;t think we were really the kind of people you&rsquo;d look at to do a remix. &nbsp;What we want to get across is that, as much as we love touring, it&rsquo;s definitely about the studio for us. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s about sitting there for hours and hours and pulling teeth out. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been strange because we&rsquo;re so used to the studio now, getting used to recreate the songs now, it&rsquo;s a completely different world.</em></p><p>Superfood&#39;s second album is currently being mastered, and is due for a release at the end of August / start of September. &nbsp;With such a long time between recording and release, is there a tempation to constantly revisit it and tweak it, &quot;Life-of-Pablo-style&quot;?</p><p><em>I&rsquo;ve got loads of shit that I&rsquo;d love to do to it. I keep thinking &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I play that chord there, or change that&rdquo;. &nbsp;But you&rsquo;ve got to just let it go. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m really proud of it, it sounds great. &nbsp;But you can tweak and change from now until the end of time.</em></p><p><em>As much as we loved it, it wasn&rsquo;t our intention to go away for as long as we did after the first album. &nbsp;And it got a bit ridiculous in the end. &nbsp;We would say &ldquo;scrap that song, re-record it. Scrap it, re-record it&rdquo;.</em></p><p><em>We definitely haven&rsquo;t rushed it, which is great. &nbsp;Now, I can&rsquo;t wait just to get it out. &nbsp;It feels like a new chapter. &nbsp; After this, we can spring wherever we want, we could go in any direction that we want.</em></p><p>And as Ryan went on to explain, that direction could be another curveball.</p><p><em>I&rsquo;d love to collaborate with loads of people. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re really going to look at for our next album, see if we can go down that route. &nbsp;We could maybe even put out a whole album of collaborations. &nbsp;</em><em>We&rsquo;ve had drunken chats with Isaac from Slaves. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got some songs that we&rsquo;re just not cool enough to sing. Like a heavy hip-hop tune with some guy screaming over the top. &nbsp;I really want to do that.</em></p><p>But before then, the band have a summer of festivals lined up, including Y-Not, Reading and Leeds, Truck and Festival No. 6...</p><p><em>Festival No. 6 is amazing. &nbsp;My parents have been going to Portmeirion ever since they got married. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s this beautiful village. &nbsp;And I went to Festival No 6 with them last year and it&rsquo;s so fucking mad. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a big dance element there, when the lights go down, the house music comes on. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re in this weird village that this architect&rsquo;s made for his wife. &nbsp;And you&rsquo;re off your face listening to techno.</em></p><p>In terms of favourite festivals, however, there&#39;s one that rules them all...</p><p><em>It&rsquo;s Glasto, isn&rsquo;t it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just THE festival. &nbsp;You can almost forget about the rest.</em></p><p><em>When we played two years ago, it was the first time we&rsquo;d been to Glastonbury and we&rsquo;d just played a festival in Holland. &nbsp;We drove for fifteen hours straight, we told our tour manager that we needed to get there as soon as possible. &nbsp;We got absolutely messed up. &nbsp;I slept in my mate&rsquo;s tent and he gave me a Valium to go to sleep. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t wake up until 1pm and we were on stage at 2pm. &nbsp;I thought I&rsquo;d fucked it, I remember running to the stage. &nbsp;That wasn&rsquo;t very professional. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all changed, we don&rsquo;t do that any more!</em></p><p>Our thanks to Dom and Ryan for taking the time to talk to us at No Ripcord. &nbsp;For more information on Superfood, including details of upcoming live dates, check out their website: <a href="http://superfoodjunk.com/">superfoodjunk.com</a></p>
