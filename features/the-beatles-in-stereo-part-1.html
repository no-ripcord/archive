  <p>Before <i><b>Revolver</b></i>, Paul McCartney&rsquo;s bass did not exist.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Convinced that his contribution to The Beatles, musically speaking, was one that played somewhat insignificantly against the audible guitars, <i>Taxman</i> cured me of that assessment, his thumping bass line providing the song its groove and strength.&nbsp; But, in terms of the band&rsquo;s previous albums, McCartney&rsquo;s role was seemingly buried. <br />
<br />
The Beatles <i><b>Stereo Box Set</b></i> arrived at my doorstep a little over a week ago, a glossy black box that was painful to glom up with my clammy fanboy fingertips as I opened it up to find its brightly packaged contents.&nbsp; Listening commenced once I worked up the courage to tear off the cellophane and accept the fact that the wash of unforgiving varnish wasn&rsquo;t going to remain pristine if I was going to actually sample these re-mastered beauties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Chronological order, press play, and there it was:&nbsp; Paul&rsquo;s lefty fiddle bass as sharp as a fresh stylus on <i><b>Please Please Me</b></i>.&nbsp; And, that&rsquo;s why this box set is more popular than Jesus now.<br />
<br />
Biased as it sounds, no re-mastered, reissued, reintroduced or recycled albums were going to make bigger headlines this year, The Beatles&rsquo; revered output barely choked onto CD in 1987 and more or less ignored save the occasional documentary companion (1995/96&rsquo;s <i><b>Anthology</b></i> series), anniversary (1999&rsquo;s <i><b>Yellow Submarine Songtrack</b></i>), whim (2003&rsquo;s <i><b>Let It Be&hellip; Naked</b></i>), or circus (2007&rsquo;s <i><b>Love</b></i>).&nbsp; The <i><b>Yellow Submarine Songtrack</b></i> and 2000&rsquo;s <i><b>1</b></i> compilation provided some evidence that Apple/EMI were at least toying with the idea of re-mastering the music, sort of teasing the populace with possibility.&nbsp; They waited long enough to generate a &ldquo;need&rdquo; for this material, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-5745-Houston-Music-Examiner%7Ey2009m9d3-Amazon-sells-out-of-Beatles-box-sets-prior-to-090909-release-date">Amazon having recently witnessed the insatiable demand of Beatles fans everywhere as they&rsquo;ve sold out of mono and stereo box sets before the actual release date of September 9th</a>.&nbsp; How many other groups can boast such loyalty?&nbsp; Forty-five years after Ed Sullivan, and Beatlemania&rsquo;s still alive and well, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
And while I want to squeal with delight and produce multiple run-on sentences featuring every tired clich&eacute; wherein I weep and testify to anyone reading the spiritual and life-affirming impact that these re-masters have had on my otherwise humble being, making trite declarations of &ldquo;hearing The Beatles for the first time all over again,&rdquo; let me instead express that this is better than hearing The Beatles for the first time all over again.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When <i><b>Love</b></i> came out, I was at first intrigued by the reconsidered and carefully collaged mash-ups that George and Giles Martin crafted for the Cirque Du Soleil show of the same name.&nbsp; But, as I listened to it again and again, I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with some of what I was hearing.&nbsp; <i>Eleanor Rigby</i> had OTHER violins; <i>Hey Jude</i> had a DIFFERENT bass line... there were elements being pulled that I&rsquo;d never heard before, and had never known to exist.&nbsp; The exquisite team of engineers at Abbey Road studio have basically freed the music from its former abyss, a mire of flattened production that suffocated the revelatory sounds that George and Giles serendipitously exposed.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In the simplest terms, their art now has truth and the band with whom the modern LP began, could very well be the band with whom the CD may end.&nbsp; Somehow, it&rsquo;s fitting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<b>Part 1: From Beatlemania&hellip;</b><br />
<br />
A group of young men become the biggest band in rock n&rsquo; roll history.&nbsp; The band ignites an international frenzy with catchy songs that they&rsquo;ve written themselves and a personable charm that wins attention.&nbsp; Incessant touring ensues, songwriting continues and somehow this band records and releases six albums and stars in two movies within three years.<br />
<br />
Those six albums go on to document the band's rapid progression, an evolution that transcends its beginnings as a pop sensation and transitions them into cultural relevance.<br />
<br />
Listening to the titles in succession, (the &ldquo;astute&rdquo; observation I&rsquo;m about to make having been explained time and time again), you really understand how much they evolve musically.&nbsp; The earliest of their albums, <i><b>Please Please Me</b></i> and <i><b>With The Beatles</b></i> especially, house the hit machine that caused their colossal elevation as a pop group.&nbsp; As easy as it to dismiss most of Beatlemania&rsquo;s output as ear candy and sappy odes to puppy love, (<i>I Saw Her Standing There, P.S. I Love You, All My Loving, It Won&rsquo;t Be Long</i>), it&rsquo;s worth noting that the albums&rsquo; newfound clarity adds a lot of dimension to what The Beatles were doing at the time.&nbsp; You begin to hear shades of what came later as the songs become less dance-friendly (<i>I Wanna Be Your Man</i>) and a little more personal (<i>I&rsquo;m A Loser</i>).&nbsp; I was actually taken aback by the wooden rhythm McCartney was knocking out during George Harrison&rsquo;s <i>Don&rsquo;t Bother Me</i>, the presence of which I&rsquo;d never previously acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As success proves somewhat ambiguous for the band, <i><b>Beatles For Sale</b></i> and <i><b>Help!</b></i>, like their aged expressions so well-captured on the former&rsquo;s cover, both wear an obvious amount of exhaustion and frustration.&nbsp; Though <i><b>Beatles For Sale</b></i> still satisfies the hit record template, almost half the album devoted to pop covers, songs like <i>Eight Days A Week</i> and <i>I&rsquo;ll Follow The Sun</i> exhibit maturity or a subtle desire to appeal to a different audience.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<i><b>Help!</b></i>, whose urgent title track was born out of cathartic necessity by John Lennon, only goes further to pull The Beatles from they were the year before: their iconic escape from rabid fans the introduction to <i><b>A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night</b></i> and the representation of what was no longer fun or exciting.&nbsp; <i>You&rsquo;ve Got To Hide Your Love Away</i> is simply a beautiful song, its acoustic melody so fluid and perfect.&nbsp; <i>Ticket To Ride</i> foreshadows percussive advances in the band&rsquo;s later psychedelic excursions and <i>Yesterday</i> proves McCartney&rsquo;s star power as a solo performer.<br />
<br />
Before 1965 closes out, <i><b>Rubber Soul</b></i> marks the beginning of a new creative phase for The Beatles, one whose chemical influence inspires the accidentally stretched visual aesthetic on its cover and their most innovative period.&nbsp; The first album written completely by the band, <i><b>Rubber Soul</b></i> basically made The Beatles into artists, songs like <i>Nowhere Man, In My Life, Girl</i> and <i>If I Needed Someone</i>, poetic, deep and heartfelt.&nbsp; Harrison introduces the sitar in Lennon&rsquo;s <i>Norwegian Wood (The Bird Has Flown)</i>, a signature instrument he carries over into the next couple albums.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As drug culture expands the consciousness of those who partake, and the turbulence of the decade becomes increasingly severe, The Beatles continue to develop and, interestingly, the 60s follow.</p>
