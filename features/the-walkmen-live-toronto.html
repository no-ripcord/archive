  <p>Living in a city like Toronto affords any music loving individual with ample opportunity to see great bands and to do so regularly.&nbsp; On the one hand, this ensures that virtually every band plays here; on the other, tickets sell out.&nbsp; For music obsessives, the best tactic is to buy early, and in bulk.&nbsp; Often I make a list of bands I&rsquo;d like to see in the next month or two and go buy all the tickets in one fell swoop.&nbsp; There is one major drawback to this plan, in that I often forget bands are playing until the night of the show.&nbsp; Tonight is no exception although, luckily I remember with enough time to actually make it to the show.&nbsp; This is exceptionally lucky, in fact, as tonight The Walkmen are playing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little about Lee&rsquo;s Palace, first.&nbsp; One of my favourite venues in Toronto, Lee&rsquo;s is a great place to see shows for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; First of all, it&rsquo;s the right size.&nbsp; By right size, I mean that it probably fits around 600 people.&nbsp; This means that, because of the rectangular shape of the room, coupled with the multiple levels, you can see the band even at sold out shows like The Walkmen.&nbsp; Add to this the generally above average sound (an incredibly underrated essential) and that, with a few exceptions, ticket prices never rise above $17, and you get a pretty appreciative audience most times round (another underappreciated part of a good live show).&nbsp; Lee&rsquo;s is archetypal of a solid, simple, great live venue.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not fancy, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be.&nbsp; It does one job and it does it well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having already forgotten that I am going to see The Walkmen tonight, when I remember, I still miss out on the somewhat important point that Cass McCombs is supporting.&nbsp; That is, until five minutes before I leave for the show and I suddenly feel incredibly privileged to be seeing one band I&rsquo;ve loved for ages, and one artist I&rsquo;ve recently discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I arrive, McCombs is on his knees, wearing a full denim outfit, including the denim jacket I identify as the one worn in his video for <i>You Changed My Life</i>.&nbsp; McCombs&rsquo; 80s aesthetic is mostly followed by his band, though especially by the second guitarist, who is sporting an oversized t-shirt, tightish light coloured blue jeans, and the creepy (yet possibly hip) combination of a weird half-moustache and middle parting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nice to see a band have an aesthetic; at the very least it makes them look like a cohesive unit.&nbsp; They start by going through <i>Lion Killer Got Married</i>, the sibling song from Catacombs to <i>Lion Killer</i> from the previous <b><i>Dropping the Writ</i></b>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a faithful and powerful rendition, although undermined slightly by the crowd&rsquo;s apparent lack of interest.&nbsp; For all my preamble about Lee&rsquo;s, and the mostly appreciative audience found therein, McCombs has to battle through people loudly talking during his set.&nbsp; It he&rsquo;s aware of this, he doesn&rsquo;t show it though, as he seems cheerful, almost playful, throughout a set mostly composed of songs taken from his previous two records.&nbsp; Set highlights are, of course for a new fan like myself, the recent, and aforementioned, <i>You Saved My Life</i>, and excellent slow-burning closer <i>Dreams Come True Girl</i>.&nbsp; Most surprising, in fact, about McCombs is his height, he looks like he might be slightly smaller than me which, being a pretty short dude, is something I rarely find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where to start with The Walkmen?&nbsp; The best phrase I have so far come up with to describe their music is, &ldquo;the sound of crushing disappointment&rdquo;.&nbsp; Over the course of four albums they have used a relatively simple line-up, consisting mainly of bass, organ, guitar, drums and vocals to devastating effect.&nbsp; This is partly because the production on their songs is grainy and atmospheric in just the right ways, often sounding like the saddest, angriest Christmas Eve you&rsquo;ve never had.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also because their singer, Hamilton Leithauser, has one of the loudest, roughest, yet strangely smooth voices ever committed to tape.&nbsp; Imagine a lounge singer dieting entirely on cigarettes and you&rsquo;re probably close.&nbsp; Of course, it&rsquo;s not just the voice, it&rsquo;s also the lyrics which are appropriately bitter, sad, angry, and let down, often all at the same time.&nbsp; Their first album was called <b><i>Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Has Gone</i></b>, just to give you an idea of what you&rsquo;re dealing with here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Leithauser&rsquo;s voice that has made me slightly anxious about this gig.&nbsp; On record it&rsquo;s incredible, but past experiences have taught me that, sometimes, great record voices don&rsquo;t make great live voices and I have a feeling that a band like The Walkmen, so dependent upon their vocals, will stand or fall on this point.&nbsp; A minute into the set opener <i>Donde esta la Playa</i> and this fear is forgotten and replaced with a new admiration for a band I rate so highly on record.&nbsp; While I understand that it is quite a hackneyed writing technique, particularly in music journalism, to &ldquo;flip&rdquo; expectations as I&rsquo;ve just done, I could think of no better way of capturing how great it is to hear Leithauser sing live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal for bands to space out their &ldquo;hits&rdquo; across sets, but tonight The Walkmen decide to place <i>The Rat</i> almost immediately after <i>In the New Year</i>.&nbsp; The former brought them fame and, assumedly, some amount of fortune, whereas the latter, coming from last year&rsquo;s really quite excellent <b><i>You &amp; Me</i></b>, hooked listeners and fans back in after <i><b>A </b></i><b><i>Hundred Miles Off</i></b>, the slightly disappointing follow-up album to <b><i>Bows &amp; Arrows</i></b>.&nbsp; If The Walkmen seem to be the perpetual underdogs on record, they are playing with great confidence tonight.</p>
<p>In hindsight, ridding themselves of their two most famous tracks early on was a wise move.&nbsp; The rest of the set balances out new tracks, mostly featuring an unexpected but entirely welcome horn section, with cuts from <b><i>You &amp; Me</i></b>.&nbsp; <i>Louisiana</i> is the only track to be taken from <b><i>A Hundred Miles Off</i></b> that I can hear and is good although sits slightly awkwardly in a set that sticks mostly to newer material closer in tone to the first two records, although this is a small complaint about what is, all things considered, a fantastic show.&nbsp; Particular highlights include <i>Red Moon</i>, which is as powerful as it is on record, and <i>I Lost You</i>, one of the sadder and more dramatic sounding pieces The Walkmen have recorded so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute joy to see a band you love on record play so well live and The Walkmen succeed immeasurably for me on this point.&nbsp; They are tight, confident, and manage to somehow fill their live performances with as much deficient and distended energy as they do on their albums.&nbsp; If <b><i>You &amp; Me</i></b> renewed your faith in this band, then their live show will make you wonder why you ever doubted them in the first place.&nbsp; Frankly, I love this band and am glad that the downtrodden, disappointed, let down, or otherwise have such a fantastic soundtrack.</p>
