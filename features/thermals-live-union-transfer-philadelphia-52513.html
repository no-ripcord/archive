  <p><span>The last time I went to a show on my own, I was 22, fresh to Philly, and of the mindset that it was totally fine for a girl to go to the Khyber by herself if the rest of her friends hadn&rsquo;t heard of Beirut yet. This time around, going to a new (to me) venue, I had the decency to be somewhat ashamed of my solo status, and figured that my dollar-store notepad would serve as social armor. I hid at the bar -- the last refuge of the nearly 30-something at an all ages show -- and literally wrote by candlelight: &nbsp;&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t there bar stools? Why is my well whiskey seven dollars? Where are the men lining up to buy me drinks just because I have boobs? I have been woefully misinformed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div>Union Transfer is no Khyber (R.I.P.). It&rsquo;s a polished establishment with several bars, warehouse ceilings, and a sparkling clean ambiance (well, under properly dim lighting conditions, anyway). I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever shied away from the pit at a show, but as somebody with a phobia of anyone born in the &#39;<span word="90s" data-scaytid="1">90s</span>, I really appreciated being able to hug the bar and avoid the jumpy masses up front. For a while it was just me and an older woman occupying the only barstool; she was graying, drinking something through a straw, and calmly knitting a scarf the whole night through. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that old lady and this notebook is my knitting,&rdquo; I jotted down. Journalism and metaphors at their finest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&ldquo;Did I just seriously leave a tab open? Do promo tickets grow on trees? Well whiskey sure doesn&rsquo;t. If somebody recognizes me, I&rsquo;m going to pull a Liz Lemon and yell &#39;NOPE, HIPSTER NONSENSE&#39; before storming out.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I tackle the Thermals, credit where its due: the two opening acts, both local and very well chosen thematically, were infectiously fun. <a href="http://cayetana.bandcamp.com/"><span word="Cayetana" data-scaytid="2">Cayetana</span></a>&nbsp;gave off an early <span word="Sleater-Kinney" data-scaytid="3">Sleater-Kinney</span> vibe (above and beyond the three-girl composition) and <a href="http://hopalong.bandcamp.com/">Hop Along</a>&rsquo;s vocalist had a Courtney Love rasp over a backing band slightly reminiscent of No Doubt. It was refreshing to see local bands so well represented and attended.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&ldquo;Just had to borrow a pen from the bartender. Super awkward. Also, note to self: the candle holder isn&rsquo;t a glass and will probably kill you if you drink from it.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This wasn&rsquo;t my first Thermals show, and I doubt it will be my last, but I&rsquo;ve never had occasion to pay so much attention. The reason this group is so amazing live is precisely the reason why their <span word="LPs" data-scaytid="4">LPs</span> might suffer slightly in the ratings department: the Thermals are tight, solid and reliable. Devotees (read: nobody) will remember my preference for <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="5">lo-fi</span>, and it may be why I&rsquo;ve clung to the Thermals&rsquo; grungy, spastic energy since <strong>More Parts Per Million</strong>. I was a freshman and it was their freshman release, but the passing years haven&rsquo;t brought much musical evolution (although perhaps lyrically, but I&rsquo;ll leave that to the studio release reviewers) for the Portland threesome, apart from some studio polish.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Loving their signature frenetic energy as much as I do, stability doesn&rsquo;t pose a problem for me. But it does mean that, for better or for worse, new releases seem instantly familiar and self-derivative. More of the same isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, and frankly it&rsquo;s the best thing for live music. Audiences go to hear what they already know and love, and the mark of a great set list is an appeal to that desire. I decided early on in my &ldquo;career&rdquo; as a &ldquo;critic&rdquo; (my sarcasm couldn&rsquo;t get any heavier, obviously) that a perfect set list moves from a well-loved opener into a few new tracks, then keeps the crowd energetic with old favorites interspersed with a few <span word="newbies" data-scaytid="6">newbies</span>. The last song of the last encore should always provoke ecstatic screams. The Thermals hit almost every mark.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We all know bands tour to promote new albums, but the Thermals know what&rsquo;s up: only six songs on the impressive 22-song set list were from their latest, <strong>Desperate Ground</strong>. The opener was indeed a new track, but quickly we were <em>Returning to the Fold</em>. While <strong><span word="Fuckinâ€™" data-scaytid="7">Fuckin&rsquo;</span> A</strong> was sadly underrepresented with only one track, it was by far the best of the album -- <em>How We Know</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&ldquo;Some guy is too excited, buys me a shot, I talk him out of law school.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What struck me is just how quickly the show passed. I had to race to keep track, and by the time it was all over (on a glorious <em>No Culture Icons</em> note, truly the perfect encore selection), I was shocked that an hour had gone by. I&rsquo;d hoped to have more time to savor the story -- and the Thermals are so good at <span word="storycraft" data-scaytid="8">storycraft</span> -- but realized too late that the story dissolves without having the tidy encasement of an album to give it direction. If I could have followed the hero&rsquo;s journey that I so associate with this group, it would have vacillated from prodigal pilgrim to bloodthirsty vengeance-seeker to lovesick fool. But live shows are for being aurally overwhelmed and kinetically over-stimulated, not for poring over liner notes.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I speak from experience and I&#39;ll stick to my guns: the <a href="metz-live-church-philadelphia-pa-â€”Â 41913.html">First Unitarian</a> is a much better venue for this kind of show. Religious references notwithstanding, a stuffy church basement full of smuggled <span word="40s" data-scaytid="10">40s</span> just makes more sense for a band like the Thermals, who don&#39;t quite fit at the revamped Spaghetti Warehouse. Better to sell out at the Church than have tickets left over at 10 p.m., I say. Probably good that I don&#39;t call the shots, though. Just ask the bumbling 24 year old who walked out of there clinging desperately to the last copy of <strong>The Body, The Blood, The Machine</strong> on vinyl: the Thermals leave you giddy, no matter the venue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>For those interested, I made you a <span word="Spotify" data-scaytid="11">Spotify</span> present: <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/meandtimory/playlist/3SMAhRaX4e6gLy2B6Yfw6G">The Thermals Set List, Union Transfer Philadelphia, 5/25/13</a>.</em></div>
