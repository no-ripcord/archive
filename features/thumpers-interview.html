  <p>It&#39;s been a busy few weeks for indie pop band THUMPERS. &nbsp;Whilst putting the finishing touches on their debut album, the band have been in session for BBC Radio <span class="scayt-misspell" word="6Music" data-scaytid="5">6Music</span>, been featured in The Guardian and The Sunday Times Culture magazine, performed at a host of festivals, and released <em>The <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Unkinder" data-scaytid="9">Unkinder</span> EP</em>. &nbsp;They&#39;ve also recently been announced as the support act for a number of Everything Everything, MS MR and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="CHVRCHES" data-scaytid="13">CHVRCHES</span>&nbsp;gigs later on in the year.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the kind of dream start that many bands would envy. &nbsp;But it&#39;s also a start that&#39;s resulted from hard work and a considered approach, as John <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Hamson" data-scaytid="11">Hamson</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Jr" data-scaytid="15">Jr</span>&nbsp;explained to Craig Stevens when he talked to him recently...</p>
<p><strong>So we were originally supposed to have this interview a few days ago but it got postponed because you were in the studio. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to go straight in for the kill &ndash; does this mean an album&rsquo;s on the way?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yeah, it does. We actually made the majority of the record last year before we even worked out how we were going to play it live. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s pretty typical of how we work. &nbsp;When we write songs, Marcus will come up with the genesis of an idea and then we&rsquo;ll record it straight away. &nbsp;So although we&rsquo;re adding bits and pieces to it still, most of it was done last year. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re in the process of mixing it at the moment and hopefully we&rsquo;ll master it in a week&rsquo;s time. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re currently going backwards and forwards between the studio and checking mixes at home; listening to them on our stereos and in the car and sending notes back to the producer.</span></p>
<p><strong>So it&rsquo;s nearing completion by the sound of it. &nbsp;Does that mean you have a release date in mind?</strong></p>
<p>We originally wanted it out this summer but we release now that was fairly optimistic. &nbsp;We thought the more we talked about it coming out in the summer, the more likely it would be to happen. &nbsp;We were so ready with the record and so we anticipated and hoped that everyone else would be. &nbsp;But these things take longer than you might expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve signed a deal in America but we still need to get an album&nbsp;deal for the UK and the rest of the world worked out. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s talk of a US release in the autumn and the UK release in January [2014]. &nbsp;But they might both be in January, it&rsquo;s still up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Your new EP, <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Unkinder" data-scaytid="17">Unkinder</span></em>, is out today &ndash; happy EP day! &nbsp;Could you tell me a little about what features on the EP?</strong></p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s obviously <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Unkinder" data-scaytid="19">Unkinder</span></em>, the lead track. &nbsp;And then in March of this year, we got together with this girl choir called GAGGLE. &nbsp;We wanted to do a cover of <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Bjorkâ€™s" data-scaytid="21">Bjork&rsquo;s</span> track <em>Innocence</em> because Marcus and I are both really into her album <strong>Volta</strong>. &nbsp;Particularly the production, which is Timbaland, who we&rsquo;re really big fans of. &nbsp;We wanted to do something that told people what we were into but did it in a really out-there way. &nbsp;So we did an a <span class="scayt-misspell" word="capella" data-scaytid="23">capella</span> version working with GAGGLE, who I&rsquo;d been a fan of for 18 months - their record is really remarkable; different and exciting. &nbsp;THUMPERS was never supposed to be an indie band, it&rsquo;s a project that can do lots of different things. We didn&rsquo;t want to limit ourselves to being two guys in a band. &nbsp;Which is why everything so far has been very much unconventional.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a song called <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Marazion" data-scaytid="25">Marazion</span> Bay</em> which is almost like a hymn - atmospheric and emotional. &nbsp;And it features a bloodcurdling scream at the end. &nbsp;We wanted to showcase a different side to us.</p>
<p>And then there are two remixes. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve played in Friendly Fires for the past couple of years as a live member and touring, you become close to people. &nbsp;So when the EP was coming about, I asked Jack <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Savidge" data-scaytid="27">Savidge</span> [drummer in Friendly Fires] if he wanted to do a remix. &nbsp;Seeing his DJ sets as we travel all over the world, I knew he was a great DJ. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a really cool thing for him to do for us.</p>
<p>The other remix is by Eagles For Hands, who I don&rsquo;t know that much about. &nbsp;Whilst Jack&rsquo;s remix is quite heavy and in the style of the music he plays, the Eagles For Hands remix is perhaps more in keeping with the tone of the song &ndash; celebratory and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="2am" data-scaytid="29">2am</span>:&nbsp;pretty hardcore.</p>
<p><span>And all of the artwork at the moment is made up of pictures of me and my sister from when we were growing up. &nbsp;The record was recorded where we grew up and it all links in to firsts and naivety and being young.</span></p>
<p><strong>You mentioned playing with Friendly Fires on tour. &nbsp;Was that useful, to give you an indication of how the big boys do it?</strong></p>
<p><span>Y</span><span><span class="scayt-misspell" word="eah" data-scaytid="31">eah</span>, it was a great lesson in how to do it, really inspiring. &nbsp;The singer Ed, he dances with such passion every fucking night. &nbsp;No matter where you are, how many people you&rsquo;re playing to, he puts in that much every single time he plays. &nbsp;And that dedication is pretty special and pretty rare. &nbsp;He lives it.</span></p>
<p>Also, in terms of production, Friendly Fires made their first record using one microphone. &nbsp;And that gave me the confidence to try that out and that&rsquo;s when we started making THUMPERS&rsquo; music. &nbsp;It worked and we could produce it ourselves and it sounded different and interesting. &nbsp;I also learned how to put a live show together. &nbsp;It was really exciting to see how the show went down in different places around the world. &nbsp;It was a brilliant, brilliant experience and I will be eternally grateful to them for letting me come along for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>You also mentioned in answer to the previous question about the remix sounding like it was the sort of sound that might be banged out at <span class="scayt-misspell" word="2am" data-scaytid="33">2am</span>. &nbsp;When I saw you play Dot to Dot festival a few weeks back, your set didn&#39;t start until <span class="scayt-misspell" word="1am" data-scaytid="35">1am</span>. &nbsp;Do you have to change your approach when gigs start that late, do the gigs have a different feel?</strong></p>
<p>I think you have to get in a different <span class="scayt-misspell" word="headspace" data-scaytid="37">headspace</span> and deliver a different level of intensity, but we tend not to change the set too much. &nbsp;Dot to Dot is a weird one because on all three days, we played at different times, ranging from 5:<span class="scayt-misspell" word="30pm" data-scaytid="39">30pm</span> to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="1am" data-scaytid="41">1am</span>. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s <span class="scayt-misspell" word="levelling" data-scaytid="45">levelling</span>; it&rsquo;s fair to everyone. &nbsp;I think if you&rsquo;re a good enough band, you should be able to play at any time. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re not a fast-paced party band but there&rsquo;s room to make our set more euphoric. &nbsp;We strive to write good songs and I think that probably comes across easier at <span class="scayt-misspell" word="1am" data-scaytid="43">1am</span> when people may be a bit drunker!</p>
<p><strong>What I&#39;ve noticed about THUMPERS is that the songs still encapsulate the energy and positivity you had in your previous band, Pull Tiger Tail, but the sound is much more mature. &nbsp;Is that the balance you were hoping to achieve when you started THUMPERS?</strong></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s so funny, this whole Pull Tiger Tail thing. &nbsp;That band was relatively short-lived. &nbsp;And the number of people talking about it now, I swear it far outweighs the number of people that were talking about it back then! &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s really funny that it keeps coming up. &nbsp;It really didn&rsquo;t feel like a big deal back then. &nbsp;Everyone has a musical past and when you start a new venture, there is an element of wanting to ditch your past. &nbsp;But anyway&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>We always wanted to make uplifting, big music. &nbsp;In terms of the energy, it&rsquo;s good that we&rsquo;ve maintained that in THUMPERS. &nbsp;Because of our process and the way we do things, it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re sitting in a room with three people, playing the music and it just happens. &nbsp;It was a much more considered approach. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not saying it was any less spontaneous but I&rsquo;m glad it still retains the energy that we had before even though we&rsquo;re playing at a third of the </span>bpm<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We were really young in Pull Tiger Tail and our tastes have matured. &nbsp;We know much more now about what we want out of being in a band. &nbsp;When we did Pull Tiger Tail, we were at art school and we just threw the thing together. &nbsp;And it was a case of &ldquo;right, let&rsquo;s start a band&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll release a single and then start a new one. &nbsp;The first single we released, we got signed. &nbsp;It was a time when lots of bands were getting signed so it was pretty easy. &nbsp;And then the latter part of Pull Tiger Tail, we were trying to kick against the thoughtlessness we had at the beginning. &nbsp;And then it got a bit confused. &nbsp;On the record, there&rsquo;s some stuff that was trying to be more serious and it felt hard to do that because of the way the band started.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This time, it&rsquo;s much more like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a record and then we&rsquo;ll work out how to do it live&rdquo;. &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t want to get railroaded by labels, any other bullshit. &nbsp;We wanted to make music without worrying about how to do it live.</span></p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve already played a few festivals this year. &nbsp;Have you had chance to check out anyone else that&rsquo;s been playing, have you seen anyone you&rsquo;ve liked?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we&#39;ve seen Skaters, that was cool. &nbsp;And <span class="scayt-misspell" word="MÃ˜" data-scaytid="47">MÃ˜</span> - I really liked&nbsp;<span><span class="scayt-misspell" word="MÃ˜" data-scaytid="49">MÃ˜</span>,</span>&nbsp;and Marcus did, but the other guys really hated it. &nbsp;We&#39;ve also seen a bit of Dutch Uncles and Theme Park, both of which were cool. &nbsp;I really want to see <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Solange" data-scaytid="51">Solange</span> and we&rsquo;re on the same bill as her at a festival in August, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Have you got any big festivals lined up and waiting to be announced?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s too early for us to do the really big festivals. &nbsp;When we started this band, we chose to work with the people we chose because they weren&rsquo;t going to hype us up, and make us a twenty-second thing. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s why things are going slower than normal. &nbsp;But that totally suits us. &nbsp;We want to make a second record. &nbsp;We want to stay around.</p>
<p><strong>And what about live dates?</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a really big support tour confirmed for Europe and the UK for October but that&rsquo;s not getting announced until July... &nbsp;And then we&rsquo;re doing a few dates supporting Everything Everything and MS MR. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re really excited about all of those dates, each band seems a really good fit for us. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re all in the alt-pop genre we would associate ourselves with.&nbsp;</p>
