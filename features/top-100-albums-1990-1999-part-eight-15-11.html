  <div>At this point in such a list, people often just want to skip the formalities and get straight to the top. To do such a thing would to be a mistake though in this case. Here, we have five records which are innovative, creative, exciting and, in their own way, helped to shape the decade. Here we are, over a decade later and the influence of each of these records is still keenly felt today.</div>

<div><img align="left" height="160" hspace="5" src="../files/90s/15.jpg" /><strong>15. Jeff Buckley</strong></div>
<div>&ldquo;Grace&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Columbia &ndash; 1994)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of David Bowie&rsquo;s ten &ldquo;desert island&rdquo; records, Bob Dylan&rsquo;s pick for songwriter of the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="‘90s" data-scaytid="3">&lsquo;90s</span>, object of the admiration of Lou Reed and Tom <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Verlaine" data-scaytid="5">Verlaine</span>, Thom <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Yorke’s" data-scaytid="7">Yorke&rsquo;s</span> inspiration for <em>Fake Plastic Trees</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to turn Jeff Buckley&rsquo;s music into a laundry list of mentions and influences, or to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="mythologise" data-scaytid="9">mythologise</span> him as another gone-too-soon singer-songwriter whose best work was ahead of him. With songs like <em>Everybody Here Wants You</em> and <em>Vancouver </em>on the incomplete <strong>Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk</strong>, it might even be true. But <strong>Grace </strong>deserves to stand alone. An intimate yet sprawling look at lost love, mortality, and memory, a keen portrait of a heartbroken and lost 20-something, <strong>Grace </strong>succeeds on all these fronts and more. The title track contains one of the great vocal performances in rock history; his heartbreaking cover of <em>Hallelujah </em>has rightfully taken its place in the canon, the imagery in <em>Lover, You Should&rsquo;ve Come Over</em> paints a fresh picture every time, and the lyric, <em>&ldquo;Too young to hold on but too old to just break free and run&rdquo;</em>, captures the sudden <span class="scayt-misspell" word="realisation" data-scaytid="13">realisation</span> of lost youth better than most artists can do in an entire song. Jazz covers and traditional carols are perfectly arranged to meld with Buckley&rsquo;s own compositions, and his understanding of music theory grants every song a distinct musical place. He balances the hard rock of <em>Eternal Life</em> with the softer <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Mojo" data-scaytid="15">Mojo</span> Pin</em>, creates eerie and dense atmosphere in the surreal <em>So Real</em>, and if you haven&rsquo;t cried to <em>Hallelujah </em>and <em>Last Goodbye</em>, whose last three verses capture the defeated feeling of a lost, unforgettable love in a way that few songs can, you simply haven&rsquo;t listened closely enough. There is a wealth of musical knowledge on display here, but Buckley&rsquo;s lyrics and his delivery make <strong>Grace </strong>an album for the ages. Buckley never needed to have a myth built around him, because his only album is itself a mythological understanding of heartbreak in all its many forms in a variety of musical styles, every track standing out in its own truly unique way. <em>Forrest <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Cardamenis" data-scaytid="19">Cardamenis</span></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Playlist: Lover, You Should&rsquo;ve Come Over</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="160" hspace="5" src="../files/90s/14.jpg" /><strong>14. Boards Of Canada</strong></div>
<div>&ldquo;Music Has The Right To Children&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Warp / <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Skam" data-scaytid="21">Skam</span> / Matador &ndash; 1998)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I once joked with my brother about a winning formula for the ideal Boards of Canada song: combine warbling, out-of-tune <span class="scayt-misspell" word="synth" data-scaytid="23">synth</span> lines with mechanical drum beats, pepper in a few samples of people spouting scientific facts and laughing babies, and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="voilà" data-scaytid="25">voilà</span>! But think of this not as a recipe for some fancy dessert or meal, but more for some sort of bubbling primordial ooze. Though conceived of programmed beats and oscillating <span class="scayt-misspell" word="synths" data-scaytid="27">synths</span>, the captured sounds of <strong>Music Has The Right To Children</strong> are fully organic life forms. Electronic genres often have a bad tendency to sound dated after a while, as technological advancements and styles become engrained and even confined to certain decades or movements. &#39;<span class="scayt-misspell" word="90s" data-scaytid="29">90s</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="electronica" data-scaytid="31">electronica</span> was certainly no exception to this, as genres like trip-hop and drum and bass became increasingly harder to listen to without instantly associating them with the decade. But despite the fact that traces of such styles can be easily deciphered in the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="downtempo" data-scaytid="33">downtempo</span> beats of <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Telephasic" data-scaytid="35">Telephasic</span> Workshop</em> and ambient textures of <em>Turquoise Hexagon Sun</em>, <strong>Music Has The Right To Children</strong> still feels completely removed from any era or movement, as it is still one of the most <span class="scayt-misspell" word="bracingly" data-scaytid="37">bracingly</span> human, yet completely alien-sounding, records to emerge from the decade, making it ultimately timeless. Mystery, of course, plays a huge role in its appeal, as everything from the faceless children on the albums cover to the strange vocal samples (<em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="“Ooorange”" data-scaytid="39">&ldquo;Ooorange&rdquo;</span></em>) make <strong>Music Has The Right To Children</strong> feel less like it was created by musicians and more like some documentary <span class="scayt-misspell" word="artefact" data-scaytid="43">artefact</span> of an alien civilization. But the album&rsquo;s true success is that, despite sounding like nothing else before it, Boards Of Canada manage to invoke nostalgia in the listener through their own musical interpretation of youth created through warm <span class="scayt-misspell" word="synths" data-scaytid="41">synths</span> and bright, haunting melodies. When an eerie, distant cry of <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="“IIIIIII" data-scaytid="45">&ldquo;IIIIIII</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="LOOOOOOVE" data-scaytid="47">LOOOOOOVE</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="YOOUUUU”" data-scaytid="49">YOOUUUU&rdquo;</span></em> emerges from <em>The Color Of The Fire</em>&rsquo;s music box melodies, it&rsquo;s almost like recalling your own first words. <em>Peter Quinton&nbsp;</em></div>

<div><img align="left" height="160" hspace="5" src="../files/90s/13.jpg" /><strong>13. DJ Shadow</strong></div>
<div>&ldquo;Endtroducing.....&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Mo&rsquo; Wax &ndash; 1996)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Reviving discarded and forgotten songs, inadvertently promoting otherwise obscure performers or albums through reinterpretation, demonstration of a crate digger&rsquo;s knowledge of beats and bridges, solos and harmonies which become <span class="scayt-misspell" word="moulded" data-scaytid="51">moulded</span> into something new: is it music? In 1996, Josh Davis, or DJ Shadow, made invalid the notion that the act of sampling and looping couldn&rsquo;t constitute making music. <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Endtroducing…" data-scaytid="53">Endtroducing&hellip;</span>..</strong>, DJ Shadow&rsquo;s seminal debut, is a meticulously constructed testament to a crate digger&rsquo;s passion; his obsessive attention to detail and adept manner of incorporating music from multiple sources into something <span class="scayt-misspell" word="unifiably" data-scaytid="55">unifiably</span> and perfectly <span class="scayt-misspell" word="realised" data-scaytid="57">realised</span> brought sampling to a level of high art. Though record sourcing had been the primary means with which hip-hop grew as both a culture and art form before this album, the craft itself gained momentum under his tutelage and even seemed to transcend (without the benefit of traditional instrumentation) the genre&rsquo;s often constrictive criteria. There is a track called <em>Why Hip Hop Sucks In &rsquo;96</em> and while, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the money&rdquo;</em>, is declared reason enough, publishing rights could be blamed for the genre&rsquo;s creative stagnation. Though Shadow revels in <span class="scayt-misspell" word="beatmeister" data-scaytid="59">beatmeister</span> fare to some level (the head-knock battery of <em>The Number Song</em> for instance), <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Endtroducing…" data-scaytid="61">Endtroducing&hellip;</span>..</strong> engages through an emotional and isolationist level. The dramatic <em>Building Steam From A Grain Of Salt</em> dismisses hip-hop&rsquo;s braggadocio, focusing on melody and a sampled narrative. <em>Stem/Long Stem</em> seeps into industrial realms rhythmically leading into the pulsing <em>Mutual Slump</em> which is interrupted long enough to hear a young girl declare, <em>&ldquo;I came to America, saw <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Xanadu" data-scaytid="63">Xanadu</span> and that&rsquo;s all I wanted to do: roller-skate.&rdquo;</em> It&rsquo;s a moment in the album I truly love. <em>Midnight In A Perfect World</em>, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, stands as one of the most moving pieces of music to emerge from the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="‘90s" data-scaytid="65">&lsquo;90s</span>. The fact that something so grand was generated through the manipulation of pre-recorded music speaks volumes to Shadow&rsquo;s abilities and, while his subsequent albums haven&rsquo;t risen to the level of <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Endtroducing…" data-scaytid="67">Endtroducing&hellip;</span>..</strong>, this monument of an album remains at a peak that few artists at his level have reached. <em>Sean Caldwell</em></div>

<div><img align="left" height="160" hspace="5" src="../files/90s/12.jpg" /><strong>12. The Flaming Lips</strong></div>
<div>&ldquo;The Soft Bulletin&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Warner Bros. &ndash; 1999)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sun looming towards Earth, a deadly pandemic disease, global rebellion &ndash; subjects of <span class="scayt-misspell" word="sci-fi" data-scaytid="69">sci-fi</span> movies and pompous <span class="scayt-misspell" word="prog-rock" data-scaytid="71">prog-rock</span> albums, not the usual fabric of enduring works, yet substance and musical brilliance abound in this career-defining album. <strong>The Soft Bulletin</strong> was The Flaming Lips&rsquo; ninth, marking a new phase in their musical journey and a path to mainstream success. It&rsquo;s not just a great batch of melodies; Wayne <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Coyne’s" data-scaytid="73">Coyne&rsquo;s</span> imperfect voice culls emotion from each line. The desolation and longing found on songs like <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Waitin’" data-scaytid="75">Waitin&rsquo;</span> For A Superman</em> will touch your heart. It&rsquo;s that kind of album. Steven <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Drodz’s" data-scaytid="77">Drodz&rsquo;s</span> remarkable playing skills come to the forefront here, his forceful drums giving propulsion to songs like <em>Race For The Prize</em> and <em>Slow Motion</em>. His keyboards and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="synth" data-scaytid="79">synth</span> work is subtle, and even the instrumentals stand out. <em>The Observer</em> and <em>Sleeping On The Roof</em> carry you away, resembling soundtracks for nature programs dealing with the complexity of the human body or the wonders of the universe. Songs like <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Buggin’" data-scaytid="81">Buggin&rsquo;</span></em> and <em>What Is The Light?</em> would sound bare without his instrumental prowess, which fleshes out every whimsical idea conjured by <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Coyne" data-scaytid="83">Coyne</span>. <strong>The Soft Bulletin</strong> is about mortality, about precious life going away in the blink of an eye. War, disease, head wounds or spider bites &ndash; either man or nature will become our destroyer. Are we just carbon life-forms with an expiration date or is there something more? <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Coyne" data-scaytid="85">Coyne</span>, the agnostic, has no answers. Yet this work is not a treatise on despair. <em>Race For The Prize</em>, <em>A Spoonful Weighs A Ton</em>, and <em>The Gash</em> are songs about sacrifice and hope. The notes fall perfectly in place on <em>Feeling Yourself Disintegrate</em>, perhaps the album&rsquo;s saddest song, which speaks for unity and reminds us of the universal need for love. I&rsquo;ll take that over any sappy song on the charts today. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Automatic For The People&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Warner Bros. &ndash; 1992)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Right about the time that <strong>Automatic For The People</strong> was released, Athens, Georgia&rsquo;s R.E.M. were still at a crossroads, adapting to the ever-changing musical climate without the company of most of their eighties college rock peers. The general feeling at the time was that R.E.M. had to follow-up with a rocker, but was it really expected of them? <strong>Out Of Time</strong> cemented their stadium status with <em>Losing My Religion</em>, and the defining component that took them to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="superstardom" data-scaytid="87">superstardom</span> was a mandolin. It was their most earnest expression, but it suited them and the times &ndash; pleasant folk-pop with a <span class="scayt-misspell" word="jangly" data-scaytid="89">jangly</span>, understated sweetness that was good intentioned but with a dash of irony. Instead, the formative <strong>Automatic For The People</strong> sessions took them in a more contemplative direction, one where vintage jangle tones were the exception, drums were replaced by oboes, and the mandolin had to be further explored instead of serving as a gimmick riff. Fortunately, this uncertainty inspired them to seek out a truly contrarian expression, one that explored different manifestations of the themes of loss and mourning. Except for upbeat, mid-tempo rockers like <em>Ignoreland </em>and <em>The Sidewinder Sleeps <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Tonite" data-scaytid="93">Tonite</span></em>, the overall sentiment of <strong>Automatic For The People</strong> is as profuse as that of an aching, overgrown heart, beating to the languid rhythm of a funeral procession. The haunting string accompaniments that John Paul Jones introduces to the songs bring about a stillness of mind, evident in a series of evocative ballads that present Michael <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Stipe" data-scaytid="95">Stipe</span> at his most empathetic and vulnerable. <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Nightswimming" data-scaytid="91">Nightswimming</span> </em>still provokes the touching image of simpler times, its strings and recital style piano evoking a twinge of nostalgia. <strong>Automatic For The People</strong> is filled with gentle, reflective gestures that demand the proper time to sink in, and once they finally do, they nourish the soul with a greater sense of grace and serenity. <em>Juan <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="17">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez</em></div>
