<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Towards the end of <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Parklife" data-scaytid="7">Parklife</span></strong>, a high-energy song called <em>Jubilee </em>bursts its way onto the scene. Moving forward with a frantic energy, the album sounds equally ecstatic and nervous. Such a sentiment can sum up Blur&rsquo;s most renowned album. Although <strong>Modern Life Is Rubbish</strong> wasn&rsquo;t as commercially successful as the band would have liked, their follow-up is bursting at the seams with vitality, a forceful drive to get people paying attention. And it succeeded. <em>Girls &amp; Boys</em> opens the album with a buoyant keyboard riff that builds to a joyous, shout-out chorus. The strange decision to have actor Phil Daniels provide the main vocals for the title track pays off with his frantic, cocky delivery. <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Badhead" data-scaytid="13">Badhead</span> </em>sounds like a Beatles song without seeming like a rip-off, combining horns and gentle guitar work for a beautiful slow-build.

<div>The debut album from <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Bristolian" data-scaytid="19">Bristolian</span> collective Massive Attack is almost mythical in how widely regarded it has become.

The reach of this record should not be underestimated; <strong>Blue Lines</strong>&#39; after-dark melancholy with blunted beats and smoky vocals went on to influence everyone from <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Portishead" data-scaytid="23">Portishead</span> and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Björk" data-scaytid="25">Björk</span> to The <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Neighbourhood" data-scaytid="27">Neighbourhood</span> and Lana Del Rey.

<div>Christopher Wallace a.k.a. The Notorious B.I.G. nourished himself with all the raw <span class="scayt-misspell" word="MCs" data-scaytid="33">MCs</span> from the eighties that pictured a life of street-hustle and constant necessity through their lyrics. Brooklyn native Biggie <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Smalls" data-scaytid="35">Smalls</span> is the perfect example of a self-made artist that lived and died by the gun without knowing anything else.

His dark charisma and his ability to twist words, invent new ones and break linguistic patterns, put him in the list of top <span class="scayt-misspell" word="MCs" data-scaytid="39">MCs</span> and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="freestylers" data-scaytid="43">freestylers</span> of all time. <strong>Ready To Die</strong> is his first record and it portrays his rhyming stature like no other document. <em>Carlos <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Dávalos" data-scaytid="45">Dávalos</span></em></div>

From the menacing creep of <em>Joyriders </em>to the kitchen sink drama of <em>Acrylic Afternoons</em> to the bitterness of <em>Do You Remember The First Time?</em>, Jarvis Cocker leaps, cackles and delights us through a salacious fifty minute tour of the seedy underbelly of suburban Britain. They&rsquo;d go on to bigger and better things with <strong>Different Class</strong>, but <strong>His &#39;N&rsquo; Hers</strong> remains a brilliant album from a group on the cusp of immortality. <em>Joe Rivers</em></div>

The album&rsquo;s construction makes a listener feel like a pupil in the classroom that is revisited in interludes throughout its flow, and the intense personal issues explored by Hill are incisive and hard-hitting.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The disaffected inner-city subject of <em>Emergency &amp; I</em> never knows what he wants. On <em>Memory Machine</em>, Travis Morrison&rsquo;s narrator <span class="scayt-misspell" word="fantasises" data-scaytid="81">fantasises</span> about a machine which will mentally erase all his regrets &ndash; then later he <span class="scayt-misspell" word="realises" data-scaytid="83">realises</span>, <em>&ldquo;The only thing worse than bad memories is no memories at all&rdquo;</em>. He recounts with irony his lack of a stable partner (<em>I Love A Magician</em>) then <span class="scayt-misspell" word="goofily" data-scaytid="85">goofily</span> yelps out all his sexual frustration (<em>Girl <span class="scayt-misspell" word="O’Clock" data-scaytid="87">O&rsquo;Clock</span></em>). And when he starts to <span class="scayt-misspell" word="fantasise" data-scaytid="89">fantasise</span> about leaving (<em>The City</em>), it&rsquo;s only more apparent how embedded he is in his urban ennui. What at first comes across as energetic, off-kilter power-pop steadily seems like quirkiness masking an unshakeable lack of motivation. Thematically, it is so claustrophobic, but musically it is so breathtakingly inventive, performed with gravity-defying dexterity, that they push towards a liberation which Morrison&rsquo;s narrator finds always out-of-reach. <em>Stephen <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wragg" data-scaytid="91">Wragg</span></em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Goo </strong>was Sonic Youth&rsquo;s first proper foray into the corporate music machine. Though I&rsquo;d attempted to align myself with popular underground opinion and hitch myself to their bandwagon with <strong>Dirty</strong>, it wasn&rsquo;t until I heard <strong>Goo </strong>that I was able to fully appreciate what Sonic Youth represented, not only as a band, but also as a cultural barometer. The video for <em>Dirty Boots</em> got me there. Before punk &ldquo;broke,&rdquo; as Thurston Moore famously put it, <strong>Goo </strong>preceded the alternative boom as a high profile release with moderate success, songs like <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kool" data-scaytid="95">Kool</span> Thing</em> (with a vocal contribution from Public Enemy&rsquo;s Chuck D) in some ways <span class="scayt-misspell" word="signalling" data-scaytid="97">signalling</span> the change in musical climate pre-Nirvana.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Out of all the albums on this list, <strong>The Downward Spiral</strong> is one of the most aptly titled. Nine Inch Nails&rsquo; second full-length record is the story of a rock star losing himself to his own damaged psyche. While he tries to fill the hole in him by screaming about sex (<em>Reptile</em>), religion (<em>Heresy</em>) or his loss of humanity (<em>The Becoming</em>), nothing can help. Trent <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Reznor’s" data-scaytid="109">Reznor&rsquo;s</span> songwriting and production has never been stronger than it is here. <em>Closer </em>slinks along and builds on a heartbeat rhythm to an explosive finale; <em>March Of The Pigs</em> combines blast beats and screaming guitars in the verses with a keyboard comedown in the chorus; <em>Piggy </em>is a jazzy, bass-heavy calm before the storm; <em>Hurt </em>ends the journey with one of the most fragile melodies in <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Reznor’s" data-scaytid="111">Reznor&rsquo;s</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" word="catalogue" data-scaytid="113">catalogue</span>.

<div>(Palace / Domino &ndash; 1999)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Having released music as Palace Music, Palace Brothers, and even plain old Will Oldham, <strong>I See A Darkness</strong> marked the first of many outings under the Bonnie &lsquo;Prince&rsquo; Billy banner. It&rsquo;s perhaps fitting that it took Oldham six albums to (just about) settle upon a moniker - after producing a work of such staggering genius, only a fool would mess with the formula. The emotional impact of songs like <em>A Minor Place</em> and <em>I See A Darkness</em> is just mind-blowing. The latter is arguably Oldham&rsquo;s very best composition, a beautifully sincere rumination on depression, friendship, and death. The record isn&rsquo;t all doom and gloom, though. There are elements of hope and flourishes of the dark <span class="scayt-misspell" word="humour" data-scaytid="133">humour</span> that Oldham has frequently tapped into throughout his long career. Newcomers are often intimidated by artists who have 20 plus records to their name. With Will Oldham, it&rsquo;s quite simple: start with <strong>I See A Darkness</strong> and the rest will follow. <em>David Coleman</em></div>

<div>If you had to pinpoint any one album that really demonstrates Blur&rsquo;s best qualities, it would have to be <strong>13</strong>.

But it hasn&rsquo;t always been this way. In the days before EDM was a regular feature of global chart music, Daft Punk released <strong>Homework </strong>&ndash; an album with an altogether less commercial, more electronic sound to the Daft Punk of the modern day. Unlike Daft Punk&rsquo;s later work, <strong>Homework </strong>relies more heavily on beats and samples than on melodies and collaborations. Regarded as one of the most important albums in the history of French house music, it&rsquo;s a masterclass in electronic composition, but an album that is likely to be best loved by those who consider themselves fans of EDM. <em>Craig Stevens</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Dedicated &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With any great band there&rsquo;s always that moment when the brilliant elements that made them so intriguing before come into contact with some new ingredient that pushes the whole thing over the top. For Spiritualized, it&rsquo;s when Jason Pierce sings, <em>&ldquo;Sometimes I have my breakfast right off of the mirror, and sometimes I have it right out of the bottle, come on&rdquo;</em>, with a new sense of urgency that transcends the trippy lyricism of the previous records. A couple songs go way long, but the riffs of <em>I Think I&rsquo;m in Love</em> and <em>Cop Shoot Cop</em> justify the time. While some &ndash; me amongst them &ndash; believe they bettered this record just last year, for most, this is the essential Spiritualized document. <em>Alan Shulman</em></div>

<div>(Reprise &ndash; 1994)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lest the grunge era take itself too seriously with Nirvana&rsquo;s angst and Pearl Jam&rsquo;s portentousness, along came Green Day to lighten the mood. I guess Billie and the boys figured that as long as everyone was claiming punk was back, someone might as well play some punk just like The Ramones taught us. And like those lovable goofballs, they never wavered from their initial template, laid down with piss and vinegar on this record. They never had to, because the formula (play it fast, play it loud and make it sing) never gets old, whether or not most people want to hear it. <em>Alan Shulman</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Tigermilk&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Electric Honey &ndash; 1996)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Belle &amp; Sebastian appeared on the scene as Britpop&rsquo;s cavalcade of excess was winding down, right in time to dissipate the hubris. <strong>Tigermilk </strong>began as a college project started by open mic hopeful Stuart Murdoch, saved for posterity by word of mouth. Its grassroots success was meant to be: the music was a brilliant mix of folk rock and chamber pop, played without rockstar pretensions by a shy group of misfits that rehearsed in a church hall. The group has been placed in the twee category<em>, but there&rsquo;s nothing cute about the spiralling whine of Electronic Renaissance or the sharp guitar licks of I Could Be Dreaming</em>, and genre-jumping would become standard on subsequent records. Songs like <em>The State I&rsquo;m In</em> and <em>Expectations </em>have the unburdened candour of a Martin Amis novel. Murdoch views the world as a tragicomedy: sometimes cruel but often handing back a warm kernel of happiness. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Either/Or&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Kill Rock Stars &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By all accounts, <strong>Either/Or</strong>, or Elliott Smith&rsquo;s music in general for that matter, should be nowhere near as poignantly simple and emotionally arresting as it is. An absurdly talented musician and philosophy scholar, you&rsquo;d almost think a man of such stature would consider himself too smart to stick with the singer-songwriter route of writing folky pop songs about his feelings. But while <strong>Either/Or</strong> does get its name from a favoured philosophical text and the guitar work is always more complex than it sounds, the songs don&rsquo;t so much go over the listener&rsquo;s head as they do immediately penetrate the heart. This may be Smith&rsquo;s first &ldquo;studio&rdquo; album, as songs like <em>Pictures Of Me</em> blossom from a full band backing, but it&rsquo;s mostly the one-on-one assaults &ndash; the delicate, fingerpicked <em>Angeles </em>and the intimate, devastating <em>Between The Bars</em> &ndash; that still prove the man can pack a crippling emotional punch. <em>Peter Quinton</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Debut&rdquo;</div>
<div>(One Little Indian &ndash; 1993)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Not strictly her debut of course, as she had released a childhood album in 1977, and had been fronting Icelandic indie pioneers The Sugarcubes, but <strong>Debut </strong>is the birth of Björk as we still know her. It&rsquo;s still her most uncomplicatedly enjoyable album, packed full of house-flavoured pop and an eclectic roster of instrumental backing from synths and drum machines to Indian strings and harps. The star, of course, is Björk herself. Here the production, courtesy of Nellee Hooper, gives her vocals room to swoop, glide, growl and whisper in a manner to which we have since become accustomed, but at the time was refreshingly (for some, overpoweringly) original. Stand-outs are the bouncing trip-hop of <em>Human Behaviour</em>, the joyous pop anthem <em>Big Time Sensuality</em>, and the sensitive intimacy of <em>Venus As A Boy</em>. Björk would go on to produce more ambitious work, but this remains her one great pop album. <em>David Wood</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Ten&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Epic &ndash; 1991)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Pearl Jam are without doubt one of the most integral parts of establishing alternative rock in the mainstream. In 1992, almost a year after its release, <strong>Ten </strong>announced itself as a hard-rock masterpiece, showcasing the grit and anger of the grunge scene without sacrificing the choruses and hooks of hard, alternative rock. Every track on the album could have been a single, and there are no half measures at any point throughout. Songs are consistently brought to brink and back again, riffs are huge and radio-friendly, solos are impeccable, and Eddie Vedder&rsquo;s vocals flawless. Ten relentlessly spawned tracks that could make a listener feel the most conflicting emotions; tracks that reeked heartbreak but were uplifting at the same time, and a recurring motif of realisation and apathy. Vedder&rsquo;s vocals were the telling factor in this trait, and he remains one of the greatest rock vocalists around today. <em>Carl Purvis</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Spiderland&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Touch And Go &ndash; 1991)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Growing up in the densely populated state of New Jersey, Iʼve never really been imparted with a true sense of what rural is. My only connection to a place as mundane and bucolic as the state of Kentucky is that Iʼve listened to Slintʼs one and only album, <strong>Spiderland</strong>. <strong>Spiderland </strong>possesses an acute sense of sprawling space while still remaining dizzyingly claustrophobic. Guitarists Brian McMahan and David Pajo are seemingly separated by miles of vacant farmland, like two people from opposite sides of the state calling out to each other, only to mutually hallucinate an echoed response. In stark contrast are McMahan and Britt Walfordʼs vocals, which act as a sort of backwoods tour guide, leading us through dead-end streets and gravelly roads, all the while delicately whispering local folklore into our ears. Itʼs an unsettling experience to say the least. <em>Andrew Ciraulo</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Homogenic&rdquo;</div>
<div>(One Little Indian &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Who do we have really moving pop music forwards these days? There&rsquo;s something of a recent dearth of great art-pop &ndash; we&rsquo;ve had a few figures like The Knife, Janelle Monáe and Dirty Projectors who keep pushing at the genre, but nothing really comparable to the jaw-dropping magnitude of <strong>Homogenic </strong>since its release in 1997. <strong>Homogenic </strong>went in two seemingly contradictory directions at once: on the one hand it has methodical and introspective drum machine patterns and immaculately detailed electronic flourishes, on the other there are monolithic string arrangements and Björk&rsquo;s enormous vocal performances. What comes out is an album that will sometimes crush you under its waves of sheer sonic force (<em>Jòga</em>, <em>Bachelorette</em>) and sometimes lean towards you with an unnerving intimacy (<em>Unravel</em>, <em>All Is Full Of Love</em>). This is pop music progressed to the point that it can hold you in the palm of its hand. <em>Stephen <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wragg" data-scaytid="77">Wragg</span></em></div>
