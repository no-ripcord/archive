<div>&ldquo;Blood Sugar Sex <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Magik”" data-scaytid="3">Magik&rdquo;</span></div>
<div>(Warner Bros. &ndash; 1991)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Chilis" data-scaytid="5">Chilis</span> rocked up with <strong>Blood Sugar Sex <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Magik" data-scaytid="7">Magik</span></strong> in 1991, it was off the back of four previous studio albums that had received relatively limited success. The punky-funk style and brash, swaggering attitude of Anthony <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Kiedis’" data-scaytid="9">Kiedis&rsquo;</span> vocals were as prominent as before, but the recent establishment of John <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Frusciante" data-scaytid="11">Frusciante</span> and Chad Smith within the band was telling. Smith brought further tightness to the rhythm section, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Frusciante’s" data-scaytid="13">Frusciante&rsquo;s</span> flawless falsettos and an arrogant, upfront melodic core to the relentless funk-punk that was &ndash; and still is - their trademark. The structure of the album is unorthodox to say the least. They couldn&rsquo;t squeeze another track onto the CD at 74 minutes in length, and the majority of the themes explored screamed downright sexual acuteness, completely bypassing any innuendo stage. <strong>Blood Sugar&hellip;</strong> houses track after memorable track, and an audacity of assurance that announced the band as the mainstay they ultimately became. <em>Carl <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Purvis" data-scaytid="15">Purvis</span></em></div>

Angry, bitter lyrics are sung with a raw emotion and passion that&rsquo;s impossible to ignore.

Some 33 million sales and five Grammy Award wins later (not to mention the record being the best-selling album of the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="1990s" data-scaytid="31">1990s</span> in the US), it&rsquo;s clear just how much of a success story it was. <em>Craig Stevens</em></div>

<div>(Creation &ndash; 1991)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here&rsquo;s a challenge: can you accurately describe Teenage <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Fanclub’s" data-scaytid="37">Fanclub&rsquo;s</span> signature sound without mentioning harmonies, power-pop, the West Coast, or comparing them Big Star? Good luck with that one. Prior to the arrival of 1991&rsquo;s <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Bandwagonesque" data-scaytid="39">Bandwagonesque</span></strong>, however, none of these descriptors would have been particularly relevant. 1990&rsquo;s <strong>A Catholic Education</strong> was loud and dirty, very much in keeping with the burgeoning grunge scene, offering only a few hints of the remarkable progression the <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Fanclub" data-scaytid="41">Fanclub</span> would demonstrate over the next 12 months. <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Bandwagonesque" data-scaytid="43">Bandwagonesque</span></strong> was a true game-changer, setting the blueprint for everything they&rsquo;ve recorded since; that it also features a handful of the finest songs in the band&rsquo;s <span class="scayt-misspell" word="catalogue" data-scaytid="45">catalogue</span> is a welcome bonus. <em>Metal Baby</em> and <em>What You Do To Me</em> are particular standouts, both guaranteed to ensnare the uninitiated by the end of their first choruses. I can also report that for a 1991 album, the music has aged exceptionally well. That cover art on the other hand... <em>David Coleman</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Looking back it might be easy to mock <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Mansun" data-scaytid="51">Mansun</span> as a second-wave/second-rate <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Britpop" data-scaytid="53">Britpop</span> act who undid themselves with a crippling sense of grandeur, but at the time of the release of this, their debut album, they seemed like a genuinely exciting prospect, and at least the ridiculousness of their swagger was knowing. That <strong>Attack Of The Grey Lantern</strong> still stands up today is in part a result of some big, boisterously <span class="scayt-misspell" word="anthemic" data-scaytid="55">anthemic</span> songwriting, and a hell of a lot of <span class="scayt-misspell" word="humour" data-scaytid="57">humour</span>.

<div>&ldquo;Richard D. James Album&rdquo;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Consider the strange, mangled grin and distorted effects of Richard D. James&rsquo; face on his (literally) self-titled album a warning of what&rsquo;s to come. Spastic, electrifying, and completely chaotic, <strong>Richard D. James Album</strong> is the culmination of everything the producer had built towards after years of playing with ambient, drum n&rsquo; bass, and other experimental electronic sounds, resulting in his greatest musical seizure. Though incredibly busy at times, the electro-fried tracks that make up <strong>Richard D. James Album</strong> prove to be incredibly diverse and unique within themselves over time, while tracks like <em>Peek 824545201</em> and <em>Yellow <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Calx" data-scaytid="63">Calx</span></em> show that <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Aphex" data-scaytid="61">Aphex</span> Twin&rsquo;s work can be as haunting and beautiful as it is totally insane. <em>Peter Quinton</em></div>

<div>
<div><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Wilco" data-scaytid="69">Wilco</span> had dabbled with the idea of ambition before, something they&rsquo;d put well into practice with <strong>Being There</strong>, but here they were just beginning to stamp their footprints into a long and illustrious career. <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Summerteeth" data-scaytid="73">Summerteeth</span> </strong>may always be considered as their breakthrough, the one where they decided to break away from their country-rock roots and completely change their outlook. Main songwriter Jeff Tweedy also approached headier, more mature themes, all the while implementing the timeless practice of disguising hard truths with warm, peppy sentiments. Yet it was crafted in a way that seemed natural to them, continuing to err on the side of conservatism while focusing on rustic arrangements that morphed into classic-sounding pop songs with luscious melodies. So while it may not be consistent with the tenets of a full-fledged album, it achieves something more valuable: a collection of hook-filled songs that always sound better than you remembered. <em>Juan <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Edgardo" data-scaytid="75">Edgardo</span> Rodriguez</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>People talk a lot about guilty pleasures. Surely <strong>The Chronic</strong> is the ultimate example? Almost everything about this album is fundamentally evil: the misogyny, the homophobia, the exploitation of black stereotypes. But as soon as you hear a track as smooth as <em>Let Me Ride</em>, your guilty mind shuts down and the funk loving part of your brain kicks in. Seeing the potential in mixing the battle rhymes of Criminal Minded-era Boogie Down Productions with the sounds of George Clinton, <span class="scayt-misspell" word="Dre" data-scaytid="81">Dre</span> was on to a winner. Add to that heady concoction the ridiculous <span class="scayt-misspell" word="“fo’shizzle”" data-scaytid="83">&ldquo;fo&rsquo;shizzle&rdquo;</span> wordplay of Snoop Dogg and you&rsquo;ve got something irresistible.

<div>(Heavenly / Warner Bros. &ndash; 1991)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>At the height of the trip-hop boom, Saint Etienne released <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Foxbase" data-scaytid="87">Foxbase</span> Alpha</strong> &ndash; a pop record with its fair share of stoned, hip-hop beats. However, their influences stretched far behind those of Tricky et al, with disco, Chicago house, girl-group pop and <span class="scayt-misspell" word="1970s" data-scaytid="89">1970s</span> public information films all getting a look-in. Thus you get impeccable three minute pop songs alongside a dance cover of Neil Young&rsquo;s <em>Only Love Can Break Your Heart</em>, intercut with an ambient track repeatedly looping lines from an educational LP about <span class="scayt-misspell" word="decimalisation" data-scaytid="91">decimalisation</span>. Unsurprisingly, <strong><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Foxbase" data-scaytid="93">Foxbase</span> Alpha</strong> has a scrapbook feel, full of samples and short snatches of melody, but it also contains a curiosity and willingness to experiment that&rsquo;s all too rare in popular music. <em>Joe Rivers</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Creation &ndash; 1990)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ride are often forgotten as being the first band on Creation to break both the singles and album charts. Handsome, young and armed with a love of melody and noise, a series of <span class="scayt-misspell" word="EPs" data-scaytid="125">EPs</span> led to anticipation of <strong>Nowhere</strong>, which did not disappoint. Though neither of the singer-guitarists, Mark Gardner and Andy Bell, were going to win prizes for singing, they turned this into an advantage, surrounding their vocals with waves of guitar racket that sound best when turned up very, very loud. Not that they couldn&#39;t do melody - <em><span class="scayt-misspell" word="Vapour" data-scaytid="127">Vapour</span> Trail</em>, armed with accompanying cello, had a fragility many of their <span class="scayt-misspell" word="contemporariness" data-scaytid="129">contemporariness</span> couldn&#39;t manage. Ride would go onto more mainstream tones, and enjoy bigger success. But forget that one of them is now Liam Gallagher&#39;s sideman: <strong>Nowhere </strong>was the moment where he and his <span class="scayt-misspell" word="bandmates" data-scaytid="131">bandmates</span> were searching for something other than the traditional. <em>DC Harrison</em></div>

<div>(Columbia &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Unlike <strong>Love &amp; Theft</strong> and <strong>Modern Times</strong> that came after, this record is not without flaws. Yet it contained much that reckoned with the great art that Dylan has made in the past and so was vastly superior to most of the records released in 1997. From the elegiac <em>Not Dark Yet</em>, which featured some of Bob&rsquo;s greatest latter day vocals, to the sprawling <em>Highlands</em>, where he found a new reason to stretch out and tell it like it is, this record provided its fair share of chills. The icing on the cake was the swampy murk Daniel Lanois laid down in the studio for Bob to wallow in. <em>Alan Shulman</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Rid Of Me&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Island &ndash; 1993)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Rid of Me</strong> is perhaps the most ferocious album in PJ Harvey&rsquo;s discography, and it&rsquo;s also a great precursor/companion to the riot girl that was only a few years away from the mainstream. But what separated Harvey from her peers and brought her closer to Nick Cave musically was her unhinged word choices and dark, unapologetic subject matter. Consider this: a track called <em>Legs </em>goes into <em>Rub &lsquo;Til It Bleeds</em>, and Harvey distorts her voice for the verses of a brutal cover of Bob Dylan&rsquo;s <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>. The urgency and mockery with which Harvey sings Dylan&rsquo;s words is a perfect summation of the album; she&rsquo;s not playing Abraham, she&rsquo;s playing God, and you better do what she tells you to. <em>Forrest Cardamenis</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Midnight Marauders&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Jive / BMG &ndash; 1993)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While Dr. Dre was making sexy sexist music, A Tribe Called Quest were showing you can make a party album with a conscience. Specifically made for late night listeners/lovers, <strong>Midnight Marauders</strong> covered areas that rap fans were familiar with, like the &lsquo;I love sex&rsquo; song or the &lsquo;Our group is better&rsquo; rhyme, but did so without objectifying women or threatening violence. Timeless tracks like <em>Award Tour</em>, <em>We Can Get Down</em> and <em>Electric Relaxation</em> still shine today, whilst <em>Sucka Nigga</em> continues to be the best song ever about the use of the N-word in hip-hop. In addition to the wisdom, you get imagination, and possibly the greatest line from any album in this list, maybe any song ever. <em>&ldquo;Cock is longer than a hat worn by Dr. Seuss.&rdquo;</em> Well said, Phife, well said. <em>James McKenna</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Dig Me Out&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Kill Rock Stars &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s hard to extricate <strong>Dig Me Out</strong> from its predecessor, <strong>Call the Doctor</strong>. They are Sleater-Kinney&rsquo;s <strong>Rubber Soul</strong> and <strong>Revolver</strong>, two complementary albums that may well have been released as a double. But <strong>Call The Doctor</strong> didn&rsquo;t make the cut here, and it&rsquo;s likely because <strong>Dig Me Out</strong> is more fully realised. The title track slaps you in the face immediately, but quickly makes way to the softer <em>One More Hour</em>. The juxtaposition of these first two tracks sets the stage for a beautifully varied record, taking Sleater-Kinney&rsquo;s signature sound to the full extent of its range. Not as polished as later releases, <strong>Dig Me Out</strong> is a raw showcase of talent: gorgeous vibrato, infectious harmonies, two guitars doing the work of both rhythm and bass. It&rsquo;s loud, it&rsquo;s angry, it&rsquo;s fun &ndash; purely words and guitar, but stretched out to the extremes of what those minimal tools allow. <em>Gabbie Nirenburg</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Suede&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Nude &ndash; 1993)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>With the release of <strong>Bloodsports </strong>earlier this year, it seems like Suede may actually be Britpop&rsquo;s true survivors. That seemed an impossible scenario just over twenty years ago(!) with the release of <strong>Suede</strong>, their debut album &ndash; a heady love letter to &#39;70s glam full of lust, hedonism and druggy androgyny. What marked Suede out as something truly special, though, was the irreproducible interplay between vocalist Brett Anderson and guitarist Bernard Butler, the intricate solos and fills snaking in and out of tales of urban woe and nihilism. There was also songwriting of a quality ridiculously assured for a first album, with the band showing an incredible nous for the alchemy of the perfect pop song. Some groups waste their whole careers trying (and failing) to produce something as sublime as the build and pause towards the end of <em>Metal Mickey</em>. <em>Joe Rivers</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;The Boatman&rsquo;s Call&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Mute / Reprise &ndash; 1997)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s hard to identify a centrepiece of a discography as versatile and lengthy as Nick Cave&rsquo;s, but if I had to pick one, I would pick <strong>The Boatman&rsquo;s Call</strong>. Cave&rsquo;s imagery is still there, but it&rsquo;s delivered with such a simple honesty, the lyrics are stripped down to the point of straightforward, uninhibited truths. <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in an interventionist God,&rdquo;</em> he begins the album on <em>Into My Arms</em>. From there, the song continues to poetically confess his love. <em>People Ain&rsquo;t No Good</em> wears its worn-down and defeated heart on its sleeve, and throughout the album, guitar is sparse and piano dominates, removing Cave&rsquo;s sinister edge and replacing it with a distinct break-up feel. By the time the haunting <em>Green Eyes</em> arrives, the pain is so unbearable that the album&rsquo;s end is almost merciful, but <strong>The Boatman&rsquo;s Call</strong> is profundity and beauty disguised as simplicity, and that means it isn&rsquo;t easily shaken. <em>Forrest Cardamenis</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Little Earthquakes&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Atlantic / East West &ndash; 1992)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tori Amos has spent decades now carving out a career that&rsquo;s seen her flirt dangerously with maddening twee-ness and single-handedly pave the way for the deliberately, teeth-grindingly theatricality of a hoard of piano-bashing divas. In response to that though, is the fact that <strong>Little Earthquakes</strong>, her debut, which launched her almost instantly as an international celebrity/figure of fun (the long, noble tradition of mocking her for coming off a bit nuts and intense arguably started when Spitting Image rendered her in rubber) is a genuinely great, even innovative, pop album, driven in equal parts by still fresh-sounding production, &nbsp;and emotional and sexual frankness. That the album is effectively brought to a premature halt by <em>Me And A Gun</em>, a harrowing a capella account of her surviving sexual assault, remains to this day absolutely audacious, and extremely uncomfortable, in the most necessary of ways. <em>Mark Davison</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Up &ndash; 1996)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Real commercial success didn&rsquo;t really arrive for Modest Mouse until their fourth album, but here, on their debut, it&rsquo;s clear that the potential was there from the start. <strong>This Is A Long Drive...</strong> is a real heart-on-sleeve record which sounds every bit as raw as its lyrical content (thanks to the production of none other than Steve Wold, A.K.A. Seasick Steve). As a result it may take a few listens to really sink in, but it&rsquo;s well worth investing the time. &nbsp;Modest Mouse are one of those rare bands who can create great music out of seemingly simple ideas. <em>Dramamine </em>is a fantastic start to an album, with a simple but unforgettable sliding guitar riff aptly demonstrating the knack for a great melody that is a recurring feature throughout the band&rsquo;s discography. Meanwhile, oddball lyrics li<em>ke &ldquo;my brain&rsquo;s a burger and my heart&rsquo;s the charcoal&rdquo;</em> (<em>Lounge</em>) are a delight. <em>Joel Stanier</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;Chill Out&rdquo;</div>
<div>(KLF Communications &ndash; 1990)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>The KLF were part of the English elite of electronica pioneers in the late eighties and early nineties that calibrated the tone for a whole generation of ground-breaking producers. <strong>Chill Out</strong> samples absolutely pure ambient sounds (a train rolling, insects, sheep, seagulls, throat-singers etc.) and at times, pieces of Fleetwood Mac&rsquo;s <em>Albatross </em>or Elvis Presley&rsquo;s <em>In The Ghetto</em> make their way into the mix. The result is a multi-layered sound collage of the American Deep South. Titles like <em>The Lights Of Baton Rouge Pass By</em> or <em>Brownsville Turnaround On The Tex-Mex Border</em> denote a curious fixation, especially coming from two guys who at that point, had never been to such places. Contemporaries The Orb have repeatedly mentioned <strong>Chill Out</strong> as an important moment for their compositions. And, as far as the ambient house and down-tempo world goes, <strong>Chill Out</strong> is the breakpoint. <em>Carlos Dávalos</em></div>

<div>&ldquo;The Holy Bible&rdquo;</div>
<div>(Epic &ndash; 1994)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s a tough ask to attempt to approach <strong>The Holy Bible</strong> with an open mind, what with everything &nbsp;that went on around it; not just the alarming physical and mental decline of lyricist Richey Edwards, but also the album&rsquo;s subsequent attainment of genuine biblical status with a sizeable proportion of disaffected, bookish (mostly) British teens in the &lsquo;90s. Fortunately, while it remains a difficult listen, it&rsquo;s also a great one, which (unlike the majority of the Manics&rsquo; back catalogue, it must be said) has aged extremely well. Where previously the band were mostly happy to surround themselves with pastiche and propaganda, their personal issues at the time saw them attain a hitherto unseen focus, turning in a bleak and angry, yet intelligent and literate, collection of tracks that managed to inform and inspire as much as they soundtracked adolescent wallowing. <em>Mark Davison</em></div>
