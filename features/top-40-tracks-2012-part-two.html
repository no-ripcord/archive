The No Ripcord writers have listened, deliberated and voted, and the twenty tracks below represent our bona fide <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="favourites" data-scaytid="5">favourites</span> of the year. Is the track you like best in our list?</p><p>If you want to see numbers 40-21, click <a href="top-40-tracks-2012-part-one.html">here</a>. Our albums of the year countdown will commence in the next few days, so be sure to check back soon.</p><p>As with part one, clicking each song title will take you to a YouTube video for that track. We&rsquo;ve also helpfully compiled a <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Spotify" data-scaytid="7">Spotify</span> playlist of the 38 available songs <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/noripcordfeatures/playlist/4CyjUVgrPf8L1smtgfwHLQ">here</a>, so you can listen to (nearly) all the tracks from one place &ndash; how handy!</p><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/20%20R%20Kelly.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />20. R. Kelly</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3ufEF45-J4">Share My Love</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Write Me Back&rdquo; on RCA)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You&rsquo;re the mastermind behind <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="“hip-hopera”" data-scaytid="9">&ldquo;hip-hopera&rdquo;</span> <strong>Trapped In The Closet</strong>, you&rsquo;ve made a number of hit songs and you&rsquo;ve got a pretty damn good voice. So what do you do? Well, you slip on a pair of leather gloves, go all <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="‘70s" data-scaytid="11">&lsquo;70s</span> and sing, <em>&ldquo;Populate! Yeah!&rdquo;</em>, in a semi-serious way. So you&rsquo;ve made a song that fits into the pantheon of great Motown and disco tracks, a song that makes even the most reluctant dancer click their fingers and sway their shoulders. The result? You barely trouble the charts which means you have a song that most indie music sites will admit is unbelievably good. R Kelly is a genius. <em>James McKenna</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/19%20Killer%20Mike.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />19. Killer Mike</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU">Reagan</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;R.A.P. Music&rdquo; on Williams Street)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You might not agree with bits of <em>Reagan</em>. You might not agree with any of <em>Reagan</em>. But you&rsquo;ve got to agree that <em>Reagan </em>is electrifying. No other song this year is as scathing or as bold, and I&rsquo;d put money on those final four words being the most memorable. And if any song best captures the political zeitgeist of 2012, it&rsquo;s <em>Reagan</em>. The absolute disillusion with all things political: Reagan, the Bushes, Clinton and Obama &ndash; they all get a telling off. On top of that, it slams populist rappers, and has the most ominous, terrifying chords ever. I saw an article at the start of the year stating that rap was dying. Then I heard <em>Reagan</em>. How wrong were they? <em>James McKenna</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/18%20Fiona%20Apple.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />18.

Anybody who had been following Apple&rsquo;s career over the years would have been familiar with the album&rsquo;s various components &ndash; the elegant yet uncomfortably confessional songwriting, the stretching the concept of titles to breaking point, the protracted wait for its release. The exception being its closing track, a jazz-inflected round performed with her cabaret artiste sister Maude <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Maggart" data-scaytid="13">Maggart</span>, which not only stood out from the rest of Apple&rsquo;s oeuvre thanks to its celebratory sexiness but, in its nodding towards the <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="showtune’s" data-scaytid="15">showtune&rsquo;s</span> golden age, everything else that was released in 2012. <em>Mark Davison</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/17%20Jessie%20Ware.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />17.

Its most dance laden track, <em>110%</em>, slinks and quivers over skittering drum n&#39; bass beats and gently undulating bass. This effortless record is buoyed by a controlled sophistication that&#39;s more engaging than any of the showboating female vocalists who <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="favour" data-scaytid="23">favour</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="melisma" data-scaytid="25">melisma</span> over genuine emotion. With beautiful poise and artful restraint, this is probably the year&#39;s most elegant pop single. <em>Gary <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="McGinley" data-scaytid="27">McGinley</span></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/16%20Mount%20Eerie.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />16. Mount Eerie</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ZWgFv0JDE">Through The Trees, Pt. 2</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Clear Moon&rdquo; on P.W. <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Elverum" data-scaytid="29">Elverum</span> &amp; Sun, Ltd.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Phil <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Elverum" data-scaytid="31">Elverum</span> might be considered a singer-songwriter by most, but for much of his career, he&rsquo;s focused less on the person holding the guitar and more on the space surrounding him, using atmosphere and vivid lyrics to capture the significance and power of nature. However, from the first few delicate chords of <em>Through The Trees, Pt. 2</em>, the opening track from <strong>Clear Moon</strong>, things begin to seem much more grounded, as the track proves to be one of <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Elverum’s" data-scaytid="33">Elverum&rsquo;s</span> tightest, introspective, and dare-I-say most personal tracks without losing sight of the vastness of the world. <em>&ldquo;I meant all my songs not as a picture of the world, but to remind myself that I briefly lived,&rdquo;</em> he says just as the clouds begin to break. <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Elverum" data-scaytid="35">Elverum</span> might still be having trouble figuring out where we all stand, but in this moment, it feels like we&rsquo;re right beside him in his contemplation. <em>Peter Quinton</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/15%20Django%20Django.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />15. <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Django" data-scaytid="37">Django</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Django" data-scaytid="39">Django</span></strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDjpOrlfh0Y">Default</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="“Django" data-scaytid="45">&ldquo;<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Django" data-scaytid="41">Django</span></span> <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Django”" data-scaytid="47"><span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Django" data-scaytid="43">Django</span>&rdquo;</span> on Because Music)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>About a month ago, I heard <em>Default </em>on a local radio station&rsquo;s Discovery segment, where the listeners are given two choices. The one that gets the most votes continues to be played. It lost to Best Coast&rsquo;s <em>The Only Place</em>, and I still can&rsquo;t figure out why the hell that happened. It upset me then and it upsets me now, because no song this year caught my ear right away like <em>Default</em> did. The stomping, chanting and chopped up vocals are more of an <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="earworm" data-scaytid="48">earworm</span> than they should be, and I&rsquo;ve never quite managed to get it out of my head. Insistently clever lyrics are just an added bonus. I have to hear catchy songs that I hate on the radio all the time, why can&rsquo;t I hear ones I love? <em>Andrew <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Baer" data-scaytid="50">Baer</span></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/14%20The%20xx.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />14. The xx</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nW5AF0m9Zw">Angels</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Coexist&rdquo; on Young Turks)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The content of an artist&#39;s second album is rarely reviewed in isolation; fans and critics also judge the distance the artist is placing themselves from their previous release, often with a view to predicting the longevity of their career. Of course, when your debut album was widely regarded as one of the most original albums in recent years (not to mention the winner of a Mercury award), the pressure surrounding the follow-up is all the greater still. And just as the album itself has to deliver, the lead single needs to be something equally as special. Luckily, <em>Angels</em>, the first single from The xx&#39;s <strong>Coexist</strong>, is one of the band&#39;s strongest tracks to date. With echoing guitars, sparse drums and a haunting melody, <em>Angels </em>confirms the group&#39;s <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="unrivalled" data-scaytid="52">unrivalled</span> ability to create beautiful minimalist music; music that sounds as fresh and unique as anything from their first record. <em>Craig Stevens</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/13%20Carly%20Rae%20Jepsen.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />13. Carly Rae <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Jepsen" data-scaytid="54">Jepsen</span></strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic">Call Me Maybe</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Kiss&rdquo; on 604 / Schoolboy /&nbsp;<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Interscope" data-scaytid="56">Interscope</span>)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Every year, there&rsquo;s a radio-friendly pop <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="über-hit" data-scaytid="58">über-hit</span> that even the most <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="hipsterish" data-scaytid="60">hipsterish</span> of the indie cognoscenti have to admit a grudging admiration for. This year, that was <em>Call Me Maybe</em>, but anyone denouncing it as a novelty tune or, even worse, a guilty pleasure (<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="yeuch" data-scaytid="62">yeuch</span>) is denying themselves one of the most life-affirming and joyous songs of recent years. Its sugar-coated melodies and sing-song vocals are irresistibly catchy and it speaks of experiences we can all relate to &ndash; the first flush of lust combined with an almost overwhelming nervousness. Remarkably, given its blanket radio play throughout 2012, <em>Call Me Maybe</em> remains perky and fresh, and to hear it coming from the speakers today is still a ray of sunshine. Who&rsquo;d have thought pop perfection could come from someone who came third in Season Five of Canadian Idol? <em>Joe Rivers</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/12%20Grizzly%20Bear.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />12. Grizzly Bear</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuG9i5cwGW0">Yet Again</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Shields&rdquo; on Warp Records)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>No, <em>Yet Again</em> is not your typical Grizzly Bear single. <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Itʼs" data-scaytid="64">Itʼs</span> sparsely arranged and lacks the dense wall-of-harmony that the band has become synonymous with. However, by eliminating various aspects of their production, the band has successfully found equilibrium. <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Thereʼs" data-scaytid="66">Thereʼs</span> a really keen sense of spacing between each individual instrument in the mix that provides the song with an endearing sense of honesty. For a while, the listener is led to believe that the track hides no secrets&mdash;that what is on the surface is exactly what lies beneath. Then, just as you begin to get comfortable in the dreamy, melancholic shell that the band has meticulously woven around you, <em>Yet Again</em> lets out a horrifying gasp and dissolves into a mere whisper of its former self, obliging the listener to immediately hit the Repeat button. <em>Andrew <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Ciraulo" data-scaytid="68">Ciraulo</span></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/11%20Frank%20Ocean.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />11. Frank Ocean</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqkYW_vcyPw">Bad Religion</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Channel ORANGE&rdquo; on <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Def" data-scaytid="70">Def</span> Jam&rdquo;)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Frank Ocean&rsquo;s impromptu confessional is short on words&mdash;two verses and a chorus&mdash;but dense with meaning. More than lament his own situation, Ocean highlights genuine dangers of unrequited love and depression by comparing the object of his love to a suicide-inducing <em>&ldquo;one-man cult,&rdquo;</em> then calls it <em>&ldquo;bad religion,&rdquo;</em> accepted simply because, <em>&ldquo;I guess it couldn&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo;</em> only to ultimately reject it. It captures the utter hopelessness that accompanies loneliness and unrequited love, but because the lyrics refer to making <em>&ldquo;him love me,&rdquo;</em> also calls for religions to accept the <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="LGBT" data-scaytid="72">LGBT</span> community. But it&rsquo;s the sheer honesty in Ocean&rsquo;s voice, the contrast between the nervous, spoken words and the desperate, antithetical cries that make <em>Bad Religion</em> so moving, capturing both the confusion and hopelessness that accompany such overwhelming loneliness. Throw in beautiful string arrangements and sparse keys and Ocean is daring you to reflect without reaching for a handkerchief. <em>Forrest <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Cardamenis" data-scaytid="74">Cardamenis</span></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/10%20Fiona%20Apple.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />10. Fiona Apple</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIlLq4BqGdg">Every Single Night</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;The Idler Wheel&hellip;&rdquo; on Clean Slate / Epic)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Fiona Apple does the opposite of what pop songwriters are supposed to do; her emotional apex is supposed to be the crescendo, the song&rsquo;s most overwhelming, cathartic moment. But the emotional peak of <em>Every Single Night</em> the quietest part, where her voice is at its most vulnerable: <em>&ldquo;I just want to feel everything&rdquo;</em>. Apple&rsquo;s vocals project an intimacy that stretches the limits of how personal a studio recording can feel. She doesn&rsquo;t just want to feel everything &ndash; she wants you, the listener, to feel everything too. There are subtle cadences and tremolos in every syllable, twisting and turning the emotional force of the song. It&rsquo;s so much more demanding than most pop songs, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful songs of the year. <em>Stephen <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Wragg" data-scaytid="76">Wragg</span></em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/09%20Father%20John%20Misty.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />9. Father John Misty</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOToiIDNRA">Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Fear Fun&rdquo; on Sub Pop)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I would say that I was never much of fan of Fleet Foxes, but Joshua Tillman&#39;s spin-off, Father John Misty, really caught my attention this year. The stellar single, <em>Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings</em>, from <strong>Fear Fun</strong>, was stuck on repeat for about a week straight. The track has all the makings of a melancholy country ballad, but Tillman&rsquo;s haunting vocals during the chorus will explain why it was seemingly unable to be removed from my stereo. The track is pretty straightforward, relying on heavy reverb and a simple guitar strum over a steady back beat, but Tillman&rsquo;s croon is what makes it work. &nbsp;He has a knack for making a tale of despair sound appealing. <em>Carlos Villarreal</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/08%20Frank%20Ocean.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />8. Frank Ocean</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s26qTrH2atA">Pyramids</a>&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><span style="line-height: 20px">(video&nbsp;</span><span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="NSFW" data-scaytid="80">NSFW</span><span style="line-height: 20px">)</span></div><div>(from &ldquo;Channel ORANGE&rdquo; on <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="Def" data-scaytid="78">Def</span> Jam)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&ldquo;Show; don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s advice normally reserved for novelists, but <em>Pyramids </em>abides, <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="utilising" data-scaytid="82">utilising</span> time-traveling metaphor, entrancing similes, and cross-sensory images to equate an Egyptian queen with a stripper and prostitute with such ambition that it leaves even <em>Purple Rain</em> in the dust. Ocean mixes psych-jazz guitar with jagged synth lines and space-age electro-dance breakdowns that most won&rsquo;t discover until 2020 in a way that shouldn&rsquo;t make sense, but instead they let <em>Pyramids </em>achieve the level of abstraction that lets it shine. It&rsquo;s a song that breaks down expectations of what a song can or should be and succeeds so admirably that tags like &ldquo;genre-defying&rdquo; fail to do justice to its multi-artistry genius. Yet, Ocean&rsquo;s effortlessly affecting croon is the key ingredient, lending such power that you feel <em>Pyramids </em>as much as you think about it. You won&rsquo;t want these ten minutes back. In fact, you&rsquo;ll opt to repeat them. <em>Forrest Cardamenis</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/07%20Bat%20For%20Lashes.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />7. Bat For Lashes</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UznHTBZIa8E">Laura</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;The Haunted Man&rdquo; on Parlophone)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The first single from Natasha Khan&rsquo;s <strong>The Haunted Man</strong> feels like beauty personified. <em>Laura </em>is the simplest song from the album and it is also the most effective. The stripped-down, piano only performance lends even more strength to Khan&rsquo;s gorgeous vocals. The lyrics are nostalgic, melancholy and hopeful at the same time. Lines like, <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be famous for longer than them / Your name is tattooed on every boy&rsquo;s skin&rdquo;</em> are defiant and uplifting, with her delivery edging between heartbreak and hope. It&rsquo;s one of those songs that makes you stop and just listen, so you can experience every exquisite moment. <em>Joe Marvilli</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/06%20Sharon%20Van%20Etten.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />6. Sharon Van Etten</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exJ3AG0JIeo">Give Out</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Tramp&rdquo; on Jagjaguwar)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I never really listened to Sharon Van Etten before this year. I picked up <strong>Tramp </strong>because No Ripcord Editor-in-Chief, David Coleman, kept tweeting about it. I didn&rsquo;t care for it at first, but I kept going back to it. Dave was right; it was excellent. Etten is a wonderful songwriter, and <em>Give Out</em> is an excellent showcase for her talent. It&rsquo;s about a first encounter with love: she knows she&rsquo;s going to fall for the man across the room, but she also knows that it will inevitably fall apart. She captures the feeling perfectly, and it makes for a beautiful, bittersweet song. Everyone should listen to Dave, and everyone should hear <em>Give Out</em>. <em>Andrew Baer</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/05%20Solange.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />5. Solange</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy9W_mrY_Vk">Losing You</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;True EP&rdquo; on Terrible)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>A rare phenomenon I experience with exceptional pop music is an overwhelming sense of nostalgia connected to a song &ndash; not memory triggers or association with a particular event, but the pure romantic feeling of nostalgia, and I&rsquo;m blown away by it every time I hear <em>Losing You</em>. The effect is brought to life partly by producer Dev Hynes (aka Lightspeed Champion), emerging from his chillwave forays as Blood Orange with a more emotive, subtle intuition for pop, and his hazy synths and sampled crowd yelps on <em>Losing You</em> make me yearn achingly for something implacable &ndash; especially when paired with the song&rsquo;s gorgeous video. The melody could not be simpler, and the lyrics are a doe-eyed throwback to pop&rsquo;s heyday &ndash; but shimmering beneath it is the evocation of atmosphere, time and place more emotionally ensnaring than a whole book of Polaroids. <em>Stephen Wragg</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/04%20Kendrick%20Lamar.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />4. Kendrick Lamar</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLCqSMDEQsA">Swimming Pools (Drank)</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;good kid, m.A.A.d city&rdquo; on Top Dawg / Aftermath /&nbsp;Interscope)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Kendrick Lamar&#39;s <strong>good kid, m.A.A.d city</strong> is widely regarded as the finest hip-hop album of 2012. Great hip-hop LPs don&#39;t always produce stellar singles, but <em>Swimming Pools (Drank)</em> works just as well in isolation as it does in the context of its cohesive and focused parent album. Alcohol consumption is the theme, as Lamar wrestles with his conscience and elects to <em>&quot;turn it up a notch&quot;</em>. The production cleverly evokes aspects of the narrator&#39;s intoxication at the 3:40 mark, with woozy sounds and distant, echoing voices, but Lamar&#39;s impressive versatility and effortless flow remain the star attraction. A powerful advertisement for one of 2012&#39;s finest records. <em>David Coleman</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/03%20AlunaGeorge.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />3. AlunaGeorge</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfCSx5641U4">Your Drums, Your Love</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(stand-alone single on Universal-Island Records Ltd.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When it came to naming their act, Aluna Francis and George Reid might have been lacking in imagination somewhat. Fortunately though, they were saving their inspiration for the songwriting. Following on from an excellent debut EP, and a whole load of hype, the duo still managed to more than exceed expectations with their second single; a sad yet sinuous bit of sophisticated R&amp;B that sounded like Katy B tackling something more avant-garde, and came with both an exquisitely melancholic earworm of a chorus and a video that was practically perfect in its simplicity.&nbsp;All that, and it was the only track this year to receive the prestigious honour of a perfect score in the No Ripcord Singles Bar column, and if that&rsquo;s not recommendation enough, I don&rsquo;t know what is. <em>Mark Davison</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/02%20Dirty%20Projectors.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />2. Dirty Projectors</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qFaFl7JVc">Gun Has No Trigger</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;Swing Lo Magellan&rdquo; on Domino Records)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Taking their unique approach to songwriting, Dirty Projectors have crafted yet another little gem with <em>Gun Has No Trigger</em>, from <strong>Swing Lo Magellan</strong>. The track has a great soulful, jazzy vibe to it, which builds up to a brilliant chorus that is guaranteed to get lodged between your eardrums. I think I was just a sucker for catchy choruses this year. Like the rest of the album, <em>Gun Has No Trigger</em> takes an unconventional approach to melody. The track makes use of vocals patterns and tempo changes that no other band is really exploring in indie rock, giving the track a fresh and innovated take on pop music. <em>Carlos Villarreal</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><img alt="" src="../files/user179/01%20Azealia%20Banks.jpg" style="margin: 10px; width: 150px; float: left; height: 150px" />1. Azealia Banks</strong></div><div><em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk">212</a>&rdquo;</em></div><div>(from &ldquo;1991 EP&rdquo; on Polydor/Interscope)</div><div>We know what you&rsquo;re thinking. Get with the program, No Ripcord, <em>212 </em>was doing the rounds in mid-2011! Be that as it may, but it didn&rsquo;t see an official release until this year, and it&rsquo;s testament to its exceptional quality that No Ripcord writers have seen fit to vote it their favourite track of this year. Chances are you remember where you were the first time you heard <em>212 </em>and although the buzz surrounding Azealia Banks could potentially sully lesser tracks, it remains an exhilarating listen. Built upon Lazy Jay&rsquo;s <em>Float My Boat</em>, it&rsquo;s a track in three parts where each section is more intoxicating than the last. First we&rsquo;re introduced to Banks effortless flow and hilarious, foul-mouthed lyricism, before the middle sector which seems to be constantly ascending and climaxes in a riot of frenetic spitting and threats to anyone who dares to take her on. Rarely has one track announced the arrival of a star so succinctly and expertly. You may be getting sick of seeing Banks on countless magazine covers while her debut album gets steadily more delayed, but whenever you hear it, you remember that <em>212 </em>is a truly astonishing piece of work. <em>Joe Rivers</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>And that is very much that. Let&rsquo;s hope 2013 brings such a stellar array of tunes. Feel free to leave your feedback in the Disqus form below.</div>
