  <p>The following 25 albums were selected by our writers as our favourite records of 2008. To view the first half of our list, albums #50 to #26, <a href="top-50-albums-2008-part-one.html">please click here</a>.</p><p>As ever, there were several notable casualties and it was particularly disappointing to see a handful of truly great releases missing out (Gang Gang Dance, Max Tundra, Ellen Allien, Parts &amp; Labor, Santogold, The Gutter Twins, I could go on...) but, on the whole, I&#39;m pleased with the diversity and strength of our final fifty. You&#39;ll have your own opinions, no doubt, which we fully encourage you to share using the comments facility below. One of the main reasons we do this every December is to encourage debate, so please go ahead and get stuck in; it&#39;s always great to hear your thoughts. -- <i>David Coleman, Editor</i></p><p>. . .&nbsp;</p><div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Jamie Lidell" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/jamie_lidell.jpg" width="150" />25. Jamie Lidell<br /> <i>&ldquo;Jim&rdquo;</i><br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Warp)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=jamie+lidell" target="_blank"><br /> Buy it from Insound</a><br /> </span></div><div><br /><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Jim</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> is a narrative which captures the attention from the first track to the last. Lidell maintains the 1960s and 70s R&amp;B groove first presented on 2005&#39;s <b><i>Multiply</i></b>. <i>Another Day</i> stands out amongst a smooth selection of masterfully composed tracks. The intensity varies throughout from the slow <i>All I Wanna Do </i>to the energetic <i>Figured me Out.</i> Nostalgic and modern at the same time, the album never fails the listener. Jamie hits the sweet spot with love-stricken ballads and soulful blues melodies - the sound quality sparkles, and will keep you coming back to <b><i>Jim</i></b> long after the catchy tunes have been reluctantly pushed out of your mind. Definitely worthy of the &#39;best of 2008&#39; hierarchy. (Miguel Morelli)</span><br /><br />&nbsp;</div><div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Thao with the Get Down Stay Down" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/thao.jpg" width="150" />24.

Thao&#39;s voice is uniquely dark and breathy in the context of cheerful arrangements, that feature banjo pickin&#39;, snare rustlin&#39;, and acoustic strummin&#39;. <i>Big Kid Table</i> and <i>Geography</i> are punchy carefree lilts, while songs like <i>Travel</i> leave you wanting to hear that sweet melodic line one more time. <b><i>Bee Stings</i></b> is, in Thao Nguyen&#39;s own words from <i>Bag of Hammers</i>, &quot;Like a lick of ice cream.&quot; (Brett Oronzio)</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Neon Neon" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/neon_neon.jpg" width="150" />23.

Certainly sounds like fun, sort of a second-string Gorillaz/Deltron deal. Who expected this to be one of the sweetest, most aggressive, saddest, and intoxicating emotional/dance concoctions of the decade? Not myself, but one of the most sublime pleasures is discovery. (George Booker)</span></div><div><br /><tt><b>&nbsp;</b></tt></div><div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="The Dodos" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/imagecache/cover-image/files/albumreview/cover/dodosvisiter.jpg" width="150" />22.

Lead vocalist Meric Long may at first sound like Death Cab, but it becomes clear this is a little more than radio-oriented pop music. <b><i>Visiter</i></b> is the work of two extremely skilled musicians. While sparse, Logan Kroeber&#39;s experimental tribal drumming showcases the duo&#39;s chops (which are astounding) and is never used in place of melodic ideas. The arresting <i>Fools</i> shows the widths they can reach in their highest aspirations, while <i>Undeclared</i> shows The Dodos can create an affecting folk ditty just as well. (Brett Oronzio)</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Atlas Sound" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/imagecache/cover-image/files/albumreview/cover/atlassound.jpg" width="150" />21.

Deerhunter may have received all the attention this year, but many will agree that Atlas Sound may have produced one of the greatest debut records in recent memory. (Neil Insh)</span></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Marnie Stern" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/imagecache/cover-image/files/albumreview/cover/NR_MStern_ThisIsIt.jpg" width="150" />20.

Her naïve melodies still cultivate a personal touch and add an appreciated dose of honesty with observations like, &quot;There are dimensions I must enter to see what I am made of.&quot; Despite drummer Zach Hill&#39;s propensity for free form hammering, he reels it in enough for Marnie to hit some strides with <i>The Crippled Jazzer</i> and the somewhat cherubic <i>Ruler</i>. Otherwise, she is her ever-unpredictable self and we are thankful. (Sean Caldwell) </span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Okkervil River" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/imagecache/cover-image/files/albumreview/cover/51066.okkervil.jpg" width="150" />19. Okkervil River<br /> <i>&ldquo;The Stand Ins&rdquo; </i><br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Jagjaguwar)<br /> <a href="../reviews/music/okkervil-river/stand-ins.html">Original review</a> - </span><a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=okkervil+river" target="_blank">Buy it from Insound</a></div><div><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The companion piece to last year&#39;s great leap forward, <strong><i>The Stage Names</i></strong>, might focus on similar lyrical themes, namely those of stardom and fandom, but Will Sheff&#39;s songs sound as fresh and incisive as ever. <em>Lost Coastlines</em>, <em>Pop Lie</em> and the slow-burning <em>Blue Tulip</em> are more than a match for anything on <strong><i>The Stage Names</i></strong>, and the glorious finale of <em>Bruce Wayne Campbell</em> is another perfect showcase for Sheff&#39;s fascination with outsider figures, in this case the glam-rock nearly man Jobriath. Consistent, intelligent and increasingly prolific, Okkervil River is fast becoming one of the decade&#39;s key bands. (David Coleman)</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="No Age" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/no_age.jpg" width="150" />18. No Age<br /> <i>&ldquo;Nouns&rdquo; </i><br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Sub Pop)<br /> </span><a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=no+age" target="_blank">Buy it from Insound</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div><div><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For a two-man band where the drummer trumps the standard by taking on vocal duties, these guys replace with energy what they lack in instruments. A frenzy of peppy distortion and gripping drums &ndash; the songs haemorrhage from twinkling guitar parts and ambient whirls into heavy washes of musical syrup. Exclusive of a handful of tracks that side-step the band&rsquo;s punk beginnings for lo-fi ambient embarkations (including the near ballad <i>Things I Did When I Was Dead</i>, shaped around a bleepy loop) the majority of the songs on <b><i>Nouns</i></b> are vigorous runners. Compared to <b><i>Weirdo Rippers</i></b>, <b><i>Nouns</i></b> is more direct and polished, and it feels that much more like a dip in a rainbow ocean. (Tara Campbell)</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Girl Talk" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/girl_talk.jpg" width="150" />17. Girl Talk<br /> </span></b><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><i>&ldquo;</i></span></b><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><i>Feed the Animals</i></span></b><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><i>&rdquo;</i></span></b><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Illegal Art)<br /> </span><a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=girl+talk" target="_blank">Buy it from Insound</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div><div><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It&#39;s hard to pin down what Girl Talk&#39;s Gregg Gillis is trying to accomplish. Consider this: the massive success of Girl Talk&#39;s fourth full-length record, <b><i>Feed the Animals</i></b>, is a testament to today&#39;s ADD society of short attention spans. In an age when many argue the death of the album, we find in Gillis&#39;s expertly crafted DJ mashups further deconstruction, suggesting even the death of the single. With 14 party-minded, dance-ready tracks built of hundreds of samples ranging from the way-too-obscure to the all-too-obvious, the album takes the most important pieces of seemingly every piece of pop music from the last 50 years and streamlines them into 53 minutes of free (Gillis released the record on a &quot;pay what you want&quot; system), copyright infringing ecstasy. With <b><i>Feed the Animals</i></b>, Gillis simultaneously exalts and undermines the music sampled, breaking down &quot;pop&quot; into a wickedly ironic science &ndash; and its brilliance is undeniable. It&#39;s only fitting that Gillis&#39;s day job is as a biomedical research engineer. (Conor McKay)</span></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="The Bug" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/the_bug.jpg" width="150" />16. The Bug<br /> <i>&ldquo;London Zoo&rdquo; </i><br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Ninja Tune)<br /> </span><a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=the+bug" target="_blank">Buy it from Insound</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div><div><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The single word titles (<i>Skeng, Angry, Fuckaz, Warning, Insane, Judgement</i>) give an idea of the focused rage here. The clinical, menacing, dubstep-via-dancehall instrumentals pulverize one into feeling it. And then the the vocals sprinkle it with convincing threat. Kevin Martin only pulls this name out every four or five years, and every time it is a viscerally compelling and shocking experience. Here he has refined it to a pure angry eye. Respond to it. (George Booker) </span></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Fuck Buttons" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/fuck_buttons.jpg" width="150" />15.

The album&rsquo;s glittering synths give way to visceral bass-driven reverberations; the vocals burst like a hostages from the soundscape. Mixing primitive beats that are fevered with Black Dice-style experimentation; the record at times sounds like the tribal rituals of some psychotic civilization with rhythm sticks. But it&rsquo;s the cyclical pacing of the record&rsquo;s interchanging elements and the precise binding of these tonalities that make it epic. <b><i>Street Horrrsing</i></b> sounds like the calculated call of a distressed planet seeking solace.<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (Tara Campbell)</span></strong></span></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Fennesz" height="149" hspace="5" src="../files/user2/fennesz.jpg" width="150" />14. Fennesz<br /> <i>&ldquo;Black Sea&rdquo; </i><br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Touch)<br /> </span><a href="http://www.insound.com/search/results4.jsp?from=76045&amp;query=fennesz" target="_blank">Buy it from Insound</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></div><div><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Fennesz&#39;s first album since 2004&#39;s <b><i>Venice</i></b> felt a more delicate, restrained affair. Given the &quot;pop&quot; structure and lusciousness of 2001&#39;s <b><i>Endless Summer</i></b> and the expansive yet spectral insularity of <b><i>Venice</i></b>, this year&#39;s <b><i>Black Sea</i></b> felt more paced, and cumulative in its build up. However, his pop sense has always been one of the largest contributing factors to his eminence, along with his deftness in creating visceral landscapes that seem to attach themselves to emotion in time and circumstance. These qualities he did not abandon, and by the fifth track <i>Glide</i> it felt that Fennesz was just waiting to release a carpet of melodic sound. By the time of the closer <i>Saffron Revolution</i> we are enveloped in white noise and pure sound, giving way to a tentative, cerebral guitar loop that fades out to black. (Neil Insh)</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br /><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img align="left" alt="Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/imagecache/cover-image/files/albumreview/cover/diglazarusdig.jpg" width="150" />13.

The album&#39;s title track is a joking and tabloid-styled account of a modern-day Lazarus whose unwanted re-emergence into the physical universe leaves him a tragic (and dead, again) celebrity figure. Cave&#39;s often flamboyant and exaggerated tonality does more than enhance the isolated and eerie <i>Night of the Lotus Eaters</i> and the almost industrial churn of <i>We Call Upon the Author</i>, the latter&#39;s testimonial-based content exhibiting some of the album&#39;s most inspired moments. With <i>Today&#39;s Lesson</i> and <i>Lie Down Here (&amp; Be My Girl)</i>, Cave croons over solid, fuzz-laden rock n&#39; roll while <i>Hold On To Yourself</i> and <i>Jesus of the Moon</i> provides the album&#39;s introspection and beauty.

Lyrically it&#39;s outstanding, from the loved-up, grown-up breathlessness of <i>Bones Of You</i> to the crafty vignettery of <i>The Fix</i>, and, given the affectionate reinvigoration the Bury boys perform it with, not to mention Guy&#39;s gigantic goosebump of a voice, the whole experience becomes a hug of mountainous proportions, impressive on its first whirl and still improving with every listen even now.

So nothing lingers in the hypnotic mode of <i>Cop Shoot Cop</i>, but that&#39;s ok, because the tunes are tight and immediately appealing and the singing is emotionally bare. The overall impact is less of a head trip but more of a gut punch. <i>Death Take Your Fiddle</i> comes close to a career highlight by exemplifying the new approach; simple, stripped down, naked and honest. Even though he ends up pretty far from the gospel music that clearly influences him, Pierce captures some of that essence on songs like <i>Sweet Talk</i> and <i>Don&#39;t Hold Me Close</i>, while wisely refusing to layer the choirs on top and vamp for ten minutes. In the same spirit of economy, the pointless instrumental interludes are mercifully brief and act as a kind of dead space in the grooves between songs. Pierce even throws a perfect garage rock tune in for good measure (<i>Yeah Yeah</i>), so what&#39;s not to like? If it&#39;s not an oxymoron, this is by far the best non-drug album Spiritualized has ever made.

Good rock music isn&#39;t supposed to come from an Ivy League school, but songs like <i>A-Punk</i> and <i>Oxford Comma</i> became inescapable this year. Even carrying hype equivalent to that of The Strokes circa 2001, Vampire Weekend managed to deliver a perfect party album for their debut. Some praise their West African influences, but don&#39;t be fooled. It&#39;s pretty much just a great blend of 1980&#39;s new-wave and synth-pop. As jaded music fans we always have to be reminded by bands like Vampire Weekend that pure unabashed fun always reigns supreme.

Either way, it&#39;s a winner. Craig Finn is one of our best lyricists; during the heartfelt and graceful <i>Lord, I&#39;m Discouraged</i>, he sings &quot;This guy from the North side, he comes down to visit / his visits they only take five or six minutes&quot;. The assonance, the rhyme, the sense of desperation and what remains unspoken are all beautifully rendered. His characters &ndash; young, lost and disaffected &ndash; manoeuvre through parties, drugs, booze, art and danger as best they can, with Finn the chronicler. The album, of course, details dealing with growing older; unsurprising given The Hold Steady&#39;s relative dotage in the world&#39;s most youth-obsessed market. This detailing is marked with energy, passion and buckets of sheer heart. And this is where you may feel free to ignore all of the above; what really matters is that <b><i>Stay Positive</i></b> will make you feel more alive than almost any other album you care to name. It&#39;s exuberant, bursting at the seams with fantastic guitar and piano, adrenaline-fuelled melodies as on <i>Constructive Summer</i>, <i>Sequestered in Memphis</i>, <i>Magazines</i> or <i>Stay Positive</i>. It&#39;s infectious, it&#39;s loud, it&#39;s joyful even where it&#39;s melancholy, and it is completely essential.

The band&#39;s &quot;calm before the storm&quot; aesthetic lends the record an ominous feel, wringing every drop of tension out of each word and note. This may of course be why the 10-track record only clocks in at 38 minutes with one track consisting entirely of menacing feedback &ndash; in some ways the music is so dramatic, any more would exhaust listeners. Nevertheless, the album captivates from beginning to end. Opener <i>On the Death of the Waters</i> begins with Meiburg&#39;s wistful croon set to mournful piano chords, standing as an aria in some unwritten seafaring opera, powerful and dramatic, only to explode into crashing waves of jagged guitars and thundering drums, huge and cathartic. To close, Shearwater gives us <i>The Hunter&#39;s Star</i>, a piano lament full of rich imagery of birds and boughs, sun and moon, and, to come full circle, &quot;waves that close.&quot; It&#39;s epic. It&#39;s theatrical. At time&#39;s, it&#39;s almost awe-inspiring.

The former became a manifestation of Cox&#39;s experimentation, his unrestrained self-expression, his synchronicity with the modern digital age, allowing room to record an entire album yet post continuous new material on his <a href="https://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a>. The latter posed more limitations, as can be expected when other permanent musicians are involved. <b><i>Micro Castle/Weird Era cont.</i></b>, Deerhunter&#39;s third full album, was circumscribed by subscription to the category of &#39;guitar music&#39;, perhaps concurrently constrained by the relative freedom of exploration within Atlas Sound. Consequently, Deerhunter successfully emerged as a unified outfit: the personalities of Joshua Fauver and Lockett Pundt are explicit throughout the passage of the record. Pundt&#39;s opening duo of <i>Cover Me (Slowly)</i> and <i>Agorophobia</i> established the melodic pop opening, only for the Cox-penned <i>It Never Stops</i> to follow, arguably the album&#39;s best track. Fauver&#39;s bass-driven kraut rock anthem <i>Nothing Ever Happened</i> reopened proceedings for the second half, succeeding the quiet introspection of <i>Calvary Scars</i> and <i>Green Jacket</i>, necessary to maintain the dynamics of Micro Castle. Deerhunter managed to be experimental and imaginative <i>enough</i> to reinforce the strength of their songs, making a record that matched the quality of Atlas Sound&#39;s <b><i>Let the Blind...</i></b>, whilst <b><i>Weird Era</i></b> proved that the band had enough strong material to make yet another record. Where Atlas Sound&#39;s recording freedom (Cox records on his laptop on tour) allowed creative emancipation, Deerhunter&#39;s studio limitation (recorded in one week) pressurised them into making a record that was inspired by constrictions, yet reinforced by collaborative songwriting reciprocation.

Think of many a Pixar film. This year&#39;s <i>WALL-E</i> was a great night out for kids and general public, but movie buffs had their minds equally blown at the plotting, cleverness and unexpected quirks. Another entry in the short list of these types of works is TV on the Radio&#39;s <b><i>Dear Science</i></b>, and in this respect it&#39;s radically different from their previous <b><i>Return to Cookie Mountain</i></b>. The latter was an acquired taste: some loved it, some just didn&#39;t know what to do with it. With <b><i>Dear Science</i></b>, they&#39;ve created a record that anyone can enjoy. The record&#39;s as accessible as anything this year, and tracks like <i>Crying</i>, <i>Golden Age</i> and <i>DLZ</i> take little time to warm up to. But look deeper, even those tracks are heavily layered, expertly constructed and are just a marvel of structure and writing. They are equally substantial as the &#39;harder&#39; mindblowers. <i>Stork &amp; Owl</i> is built a dance like track, putting just layers and layers of choirs, strings and synths upon each other. <i>Lover&#39;s Day</i> is just about the best song about sex ever made, even though the carnival stomp may set you off at first. But all the brilliance in the record is really centered around a single entry of about five-and-a-half minutes. <i>Love Dog</i> is a song so dense, so layered, so mind-blowing and so divine that it sounds like something you&#39;d hear in heaven. I dare you to make a list of all audio tracks crammed into the song. By the time you&#39;re done, the gents will have another record out.

Then, for a couple of albums, like Allison in<i> The Breakfast Club</i>, Mr Gonzalez went all difficult and unfriendly on us. <b><i>Saturdays = Youth</i></b> is the album of our requited love, a modern soundtrack to the perfect 80s high-school flick, with Kate Bush, Genesis, late Bee Gees and even a bit of Depeche Mode thrown into a clunky retro blender. It still has the bird noises and multiple synths we&#39;d expect, but the sensibility is of pure bubblegum pop, particularly in the Frenchified and charmingly naïve lyrics. It&#39;s a relentlessly summery, upbeat album that perfectly suited a year so lacking in any other reasons for cheer. I&#39;m even willing to overlook some highly questionable <i>Skins</i>-meets-<i>Barely Legal</i> artwork and instead put <i>Graveyard Girl</i>, my song of the year, on repeat again and again and again.

Late last year, he emerged from a Thoreau-like immersion into nature and reflective isolation that yielded his debut, <b><i>For Emma</i></b>. His story was not so much novel as much as it encapsulated a zeitgeist. After all, weren&#39;t we looking for a young, talented, little-known, Midwesterner with a grass-roots following and an internet-savvy, DIY work ethic? Weren&#39;t we looking for someone to inspire us with thoughtful, intense, and at times cathartic performances? Did we not seek someone with the ability to draw in supporters of all persuasions; from the East-coast psych-folkers to the Southern alt-country rockers, the Heartland post-rockers, the West-coast noise-rockers and hell, <a href="http://www.jagjaguwar.com/news.php#221" target="_blank">even a few thousand soccer moms for good measure</a>? Perhaps, for just a moment, <b><i>For Emma </i></b>made you remember what it was like to be vulnerable and unguarded by a shroud of cynicism.

The Portishead outcasts just took an extra decade, convinced us all they were no more, and completely revised their aesthetic to really creep the fuck out of us, as if the ghosts of <b><i>Mezzanine</i></b> and <b><i>Angels With Dirty Faces</i></b> weren&#39;t scary enough. In coming back, Portishead reintroduced an emotional vitality and edginess with a purpose into buzzy indiepop circles that had gotten sick with dizziness from chasing their own tails. And <i>Magic Doors</i> is entry number two in the vaginal metaphor torch song hall of fame Beth Gibbons created 14 years ago with <i>Glory Box</i>.

If you heard it, <b><i>Fleet Foxes</i></b> was most likely your soundtrack to the second half of 2008; even a lukewarm review on this very site couldn&#39;t hold these guys back. Seemingly disparate influences such as folk, psychedelia, Sacred Harp singing, and the Beach Boys meshed together in a startlingly effective way and vocally, well, nothing even came close. To cap it off, seeing Fleet Foxes live made for pretty much the best ninety minutes of my year.
