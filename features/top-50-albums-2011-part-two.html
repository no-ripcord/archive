  <div>The jury is out on whether 2011 was a vintage year for music, but it was certainly a rich and varied one, as our albums of the year list showcases. 26 writers casting 390 votes for 207 different records has come to this - the final list on the music that thrilled us, moved us, made us smile, made us cry, made us dance, caused our hearts to race, <span word="soundtracked" data-scaytid="1">soundtracked</span> our lives, completely immersed us and got us typing furiously in 2011. We hope you enjoy the list - if you do, why not tweet a link to it or share it on Facebook? You can also get involved in lively debate using the <span word="Disqus" data-scaytid="2">Disqus</span> box at the bottom of the page.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This list is a pretty huge undertaking on an annual basis. We won&#39;t be resting on our laurels here at No Ripcord though - we&#39;re already planning for 2012 and we hope to see you there. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all our readers. <em>Joe Rivers, Features Editor</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The exciting thing about music in 2011 is how there&#39;s a platform for the weirdest, most anti-commercial facets of every genre - perhaps most notably with <span word="Shabazz" data-scaytid="4">Shabazz</span> Palaces&#39; effortlessly unique deconstruction of hip-hop, <strong>Black Up</strong>. Ishmael Butler (formerly of 90s jazz-rap <span word="grammy" data-scaytid="5">grammy</span> winners <span word="Digable" data-scaytid="6">Digable</span> Planets) spits over beats so murky and unstable you&#39;d think it&#39;d be impossible to flow over them, yet he does so with a densely abstract lyricism which can be difficult to follow - such is the enigma of <strong>Black Up</strong>. <span word="Diss" data-scaytid="8">Diss</span> track, <em>Yeah You</em>, sounds like it&#39;s aimed at mainstream rap as a whole, as Butler assumes a hyper-literate approximation of hip-hop aggression, to ridicule the mindlessness of his peers. It is a wonderfully odd album, full of potent, subversive darkness. (Stephen <span word="Wragg" data-scaytid="9">Wragg</span>)</div>

<div><strong>House of Balloons</strong> didn&rsquo;t hit me as great at first. I remember when it finally did, and it was driving at <span word="2am" data-scaytid="11">2am</span>, trying to climb a mountain in a brief weather window. It was dark and rainy, and I had <em>Loft Music</em> in my head all the way up the snowy slopes. At around <span word="5am" data-scaytid="13">5am</span> I got a text from a friend back home: &ldquo;dude, The <span word="Weeknd" data-scaytid="12">Weeknd</span> is fucking awesome.&rdquo; It was in my head; its dark, sinful picture of an empty and hollow man was in my head, and it would be a while before it left. Abel <span word="Tesfaye" data-scaytid="15">Tesfaye</span> paints a disturbing portrait of a trapped life, a life he always wanted but one that has left him dead inside. He remarkably opens up this painful world to the rest of us, and makes you feel every word he sings. (Andrew <span word="Baer" data-scaytid="16">Baer</span>)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s easy to see the favoritism playing out between consumers and entertainment technology these days. High-definition televisions and three-dimensional movie <span word="theatres" data-scaytid="21">theatres</span> have quickly become universal quality standards whereas, in the same breath, lousily ripped <span word="mp3s" data-scaytid="22">mp3s</span> and torrents have become the musical norm. The record industry is in a state of collapse &ndash; sure, we all know that &ndash; but so is the value of music as art. No album points this out as hypnotically as <strong><span word="Ravedeath" data-scaytid="19">Ravedeath</span>, 1972</strong>. Using a two-day church organ session as foundation, Tim <span word="Hecker" data-scaytid="23">Hecker</span> took these twelve compositions to dust, disassembling their solemn appeal (available on the companion release <strong>Dropped Pianos</strong>) and battering them with serrated, digital fuzz. Despite such a minimal palette, what blossoms from <span word="Hecker’s" data-scaytid="26">Hecker&rsquo;s</span> decay is nothing short of earthshaking; a darkly persuasive tapestry of abused sounds rising for redemption. Of course, all of the loose music-versus-culture theory stirred up by <span word="Hecker’s" data-scaytid="27">Hecker&rsquo;s</span> approach would mean nothing without his melodic spare parts assembling into something compelling. And luckily for us, <strong><span word="Ravedeath" data-scaytid="25">Ravedeath</span>, 1972</strong>&rsquo;s conflicted heart is downright intoxicating. (Ryan Pratt)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Growing up in <span word="Cumbria" data-scaytid="29">Cumbria</span> in the 90s, there was very little to shout about in terms of a local music scene. I imagine little has changed in that sense, but thanks to two groups of <span word="Cumbrian" data-scaytid="30">Cumbrian</span> ex-pats, we at least have some local musical heroes to cherish. British Sea Power were the trailblazers, but in recent years, Wild Beasts have emerged as the premier band with <span word="Cumbrian" data-scaytid="31">Cumbrian</span> roots. Although musically more understated than its predecessor, the 2009 breakthrough <strong>Two Dancers</strong>, <strong>Smother </strong>is arguably Wild Beasts&#39; strongest album to date. The band&#39;s trademark tales of sexual depravity fit more comfortably alongside the sensual groove of tracks like <em>Bed of Nails</em> and <em>Plaything</em>, and what <strong>Smother </strong>lacks in immediacy - there&#39;s nothing quite like <em>Hooting &amp; Howling</em> or <em>All The King&#39;s Men</em> here - it more than makes up for in depth and consistency. How it missed out on a Mercury nomination, I&#39;ll never know. (David Coleman)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Space Is Only Noise</strong>, a record that defies categorization like no other in 2011, was my personal favorite this year. It wasn&rsquo;t right away. I liked it at first, but didn&rsquo;t adore it. I played it a lot when</div>
<div>I reviewed it last winter, but not much after that. I put it on again last summer, and it blew me away. It&rsquo;s a cohesive whole, but the details are what make it great. The way the claps decay a little differently each time on <em>Keep Me There</em>, or the way the keyboards interlock with the heavy kick drum on <em>Too Many Kids Finding Rain In The Dust</em>. I&rsquo;m never really sure if sounds are played by <span word="Jaar" data-scaytid="33">Jaar</span> or sampled and chopped up. The line is blurred, and it adds to the mystery of the album. In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where they came from. They&rsquo;re great, and they all add up just right. He successfully does a lot with a little, and no-one else can make nothing but bass, a keyboard and an 808 sound so rich. (Andrew <span word="Baer" data-scaytid="34">Baer</span>)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of the most welcome surprises of 2011 was that Kate Bush released not one, but two (almost) new albums. <strong>Director&rsquo;s Cut</strong> was an update of old material, whilst <strong>50 Words For Snow</strong> is a wintertime concept album of sorts. The relatively spare, piano-based arrangements give the album an intimate feel, and some of the subjects are as unexpected - and bizarre - as ever; <em>Snowed In At Wheeler Street</em> (a duet with Elton John) tells a tale of two would-be lovers in various incarnations at different points in history, and <em>Snowflake </em>documents a snowflake&rsquo;s descent to the ground. This album is a remarkable, meandering song cycle which serves to further cement her position as the High Priestess of British singer-songwriter pop.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jamie xx has produced some of the finest remixes of the last couple of years. His versions of Adele&#39;s <em>Rolling in the Deep</em>, Florence + the Machine vs The xx&#39;s <em>You Got the Love</em> and Radiohead&#39;s <em>Bloom </em>are all fine illustrations of his ability to &quot;shuffle&quot; a tune. &nbsp;But his greatest achievement to date is the fantastic <strong>We&#39;re New Here</strong>, an ambitious reworking of Gil Scott-Heron&#39;s already brilliant album <strong>I&#39;m New Here</strong> (an album which made last year&#39;s No Ripcord Top 50). &nbsp;I use the term &quot;reworking&quot; rather than remix, because most of the tracks on <strong>We&#39;re New Here</strong> bear little resemblance to the originals, the songs often having been entirely reconstructed. &nbsp;With <span word="basslines" data-scaytid="39">basslines</span>, beats and samples added, Jamie&#39;s work is a wholly different experience to Gil&#39;s, and one of the most <span word="avant-garde" data-scaytid="40">avant-garde</span> and forward-thinking albums of the year.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The magic of <strong>Metals </strong>resides somewhere between a whispered lyric and a full orchestra hit. It seems to contradict, reinvent and reinforce itself track after track, but Leslie <span word="Feist&#039;s" data-scaytid="43">Feist&#39;s</span> deft touch allows each song to inhabit its own niche, while contributing vitally to the whole album. <span word="Feist&#039;s" data-scaytid="44">Feist&#39;s</span> voice is commanding yet lithe, and the album maintains both cohesiveness and impressive variety: <em>A Commotion</em> features staccato strings and a shouted chorus; on <em>Anti-Pioneer</em>, <span word="Feist" data-scaytid="45">Feist</span> inflects her vocals with subtle anguish; <em>Cicadas And Gulls</em> is stripped-down acoustic. Most of all, <strong>Metals </strong>manages to be expansive while maintaining an alluring intimacy and this incredible contradiction, among its many others, makes for one powerful album.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2011 saw the first studio release from Tom Waits since 2004&rsquo;s <strong>Real Gone</strong>, the refreshingly solid <strong>Bad As Me</strong>. Though Waits&rsquo; familiar brand of gruff eccentricity and primal poetic prowess is retread throughout the album, <strong>Bad As Me</strong> is an able demonstration of an artist whose age has only pushed him to remain relevant and worthy of his loyal following. The oil-caked locomotion of a song like <em>Chicago</em>, Marc <span word="Ribot" data-scaytid="47">Ribot</span> and Keith Richards in tow, excites the senses and romanticizes the urban jungle, while a song like <em>Kiss Me</em> evokes lounge-bred second-hand smoke and a bottomless glass of liquid misery. <em>Hell Broke Luce</em>, Waits&rsquo; expletive-laced anti-war stream of consciousness airs like a protest on the battlefield, hostility&rsquo;s true victim the humanity that Waits will otherwise narrate while it&rsquo;s either on the cusp of hip-swinging good time (<em>Satisfied</em>) or in the midst of endearment and possible heartache (<em>Last Leaf</em>). Waits&rsquo; voice continues to enjoy longevity, his truth a reward to those of us lucky enough to notice. (Sean Caldwell)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the heels of 2009&rsquo;s heart-shattering <strong>Hospice</strong>, The Antlers&rsquo; eagerly anticipated sophomore album (fourth if you include Peter <span word="Silberman’s" data-scaytid="49">Silberman&rsquo;s</span> solo projects under the same name) proves only slightly less depressing but no less gorgeous. <strong>Burst Apart</strong> showcases <span word="Silberman’s" data-scaytid="50">Silberman&rsquo;s</span> strengthened voice and a more comfortable, confident band through a series of vignettes. From the beginning, we are taken on a journey through one of the most atmospheric, layered <span word="soundscapes" data-scaytid="52">soundscapes</span> in recent memory with lyrics as strong as Peter has penned before. By the time we get to the end, we feel like we have been through every experience <span word="Silberman" data-scaytid="53">Silberman</span> has shown us. With <strong>Burst Apart</strong> we finally have an album to portray love for what it is: a risk, but a necessary one if you&rsquo;re <em>&ldquo;not going to die alone&rdquo;</em>.

<div>Los <span word="Campesinos" data-scaytid="56">Campesinos</span>! have developed an awful lot since the hyperactive, <span word="twee" data-scaytid="59">twee</span> pop of their 2008 debut, <strong>Hold On Now, Youngster&hellip;</strong>, especially considering they&#39;re perhaps the biggest &quot;cult&quot; band in Britain. Now on their fourth album, they&#39;ve refined since last year&#39;s brilliant (but inconsistent) <strong>Romance Is Boring</strong>, dispensing with their glockenspiels and yelps. Instead, this is the most immaculately-produced LC! record yet, thanks to Jon <span word="Goodmanson&#039;s" data-scaytid="60">Goodmanson&#39;s</span> ability to harness their characteristic <span word="maximalism" data-scaytid="61">maximalism</span>, and accordingly, Gareth&#39;s lyrics tend towards more rewarding extended metaphors rather than snide one-liners, while retaining his knack for ugly detail.

<div>Over the past ten years, <span word="M83’s" data-scaytid="88">M83&rsquo;s</span> Anthony Gonzalez has made the transition from intricate and predominantly instrumental <span word="electro-shoegaze" data-scaytid="89">electro-shoegaze</span> to huge electro-rock anthems. <strong>Hurry Up, We&#39;re Dreaming</strong> is likely to be hated by fans of the older material but loved by new converts. It is so grandiose that it becomes almost over-the-top in places; it is, after all, a whopping 22 track double album, a monumental task for even the best musicians. Luckily, Gonzalez gets it almost spot-on, with just the right number of instrumental segue pieces keeping the pace expansive, but not <span word="laboured" data-scaytid="90">laboured</span>. Some of the songs on here are the strongest he&rsquo;s ever written; <em>Midnight City</em> and <em>New Map</em> in particular being especially great. It fails in places &ndash; there are a few moments of boredom where it seems as though he is struggling to flesh out a weak idea, but these are few and far between. Overall, this is one of his best records, and a more-than-respectable attempt at an album of this scope. (Andrew <span word="Hirst" data-scaytid="91">Hirst</span>)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A common criticism made about Real Estate is how facile and oversimplified they make their songs. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss a ringing, twangy melody and label it as merely proficient, especially when there are copious niche labels that specialize in providing this kind of music at a set value. The reasons to explain their worth on modern pop music are just as simple. The Jersey foursome do have a remarkable sense of melody &ndash; yes, melody, a term that&rsquo;s universally associated with any artist who follows a linear pattern of musical tones. It&rsquo;s a standard, but the way in which they bring to life a chromatic vivacity to such repetition is uncontested &ndash; the tuneful guitar variations of <em>Municipality</em>, the bittersweet reverie of <em>Three Blocks</em> and the joyful elation of <em>It&rsquo;s Real</em>. All these moments capped with a subtle progression of production values, a component that would&rsquo;ve augmented the mood in their needlessly achromatic debut. As much as one tries to fully <span word="gauge" data-scaytid="93">gauge</span> the reasons why, leaving out any logic is best - the <span word="likeability" data-scaytid="94">likeability</span> of Real Estate is hard to explain because it already lives within you. As long as there&rsquo;s a reason to reflect in the past, they will always provide just the appropriate soundtrack to enliven one&rsquo;s gradually diminishing memory.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</strong> is that rare album that manages to remind listeners of countless great bands without sounding like any of them. Calling on the breezy guitars of R.E.M. and often adapting a vocal style similar to Elliott Smith&rsquo;s, Christopher Owens&rsquo; influences are worn on his sleeve but hidden by his great songwriting and Chet White&rsquo;s layered production that showcases Girls&rsquo; inclination to make sure that every instrument is always doing something important. It seems impossible to think that a band with just two albums is so comfortable balancing their influences with their own dancing riffs and emotive solos, but that&rsquo;s exactly what this album gives us, perfectly timed to make us feel exactly what Owens and White want us to. With their alternately emotive and playful lyrics and the alternately light and callousing guitar parts, Girls has given us something to savor.

<div>Gang Gang Dance&#39;s fourth album begins with the by now almost famous dictum, <em>&quot;I can hear everything, it&#39;s everything time...&quot;</em> As a manifesto it&#39;s fitting, as <strong>Eye Contact</strong> doesn&#39;t just skip over the boundaries of musical style, it smashes them down. Many reviews of the album this year have <span word="focussed" data-scaytid="100">focussed</span> on this musical <span word="polyglottism" data-scaytid="102">polyglottism</span>, but few have remarked on the unadorned, unselfconscious joy that these songs pervade.

Opener, <em>Glass Jar</em>, is 11 minutes long, but passes like a four minute pop song, with <span word="prog-like" data-scaytid="119">prog-like</span> <span word="synths" data-scaytid="120">synths</span>, guitar solos, even hints of steel drum. Short, interstitial sections of melody or sampled sound provide respite between tracks, giving the album structure and form, like an expertly arranged dance set. The song-writing is skillful, the production is immaculate, the musicianship is amazing. No other album this year has so successfully married a forward-thinking, experimental technique with simply great pop music. <strong>Let England Shake</strong> may be getting all the critical plaudits, but <strong>Eye Contact</strong> is the album I have come back to most often, and will continue to do so.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Only a short while ago, the suggestion that <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="121">dubstep</span> would inspire a BRIT-school alumnus to create an album of chart-bothering songs would probably have acted as its death knell. Yet, instead Katy B&#39;s <strong>On A Mission</strong> gave the increasingly navel-gazing genre a much needed kick up the <span word="arse" data-scaytid="123">arse</span>. Of course Katy isn&#39;t the school&#39;s typical graduate, going from that manufactured pop factory to working with former-pirate radio station Rinse and some of its most <span word="bleedingly" data-scaytid="124">bleedingly</span> cutting-edge talent in <span word="Benga" data-scaytid="125">Benga</span> and <span word="Skream" data-scaytid="126">Skream</span>, whose production went beyond the <span word="now-clichéd" data-scaytid="127">now-clichéd</span> <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="122">dubstep</span> <span word="wub-wub-wub" data-scaytid="129">wub-wub-wub</span> (though it is present, propping up her properly amazing debut single <em>Katy On A Mission</em>) to take in (nu-)rave and electro amongst many other influences. Perhaps the key to <strong>On A Mission</strong>&#39;s appeal though was that, in addition to its <span word="gobbiness" data-scaytid="130">gobbiness</span> and attitude, it also managed to be beautiful, adorable and a great straight-up pop album in its own right too.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kurt Vile is not the best singer you will ever hear. Nor is he any kind of virtuoso musician. What sets him apart is excellent songwriting - and on this, his fourth album, he&#39;s toned down the often raucous feel of his previous albums into a gentler, more introspective record. Sonically, it retains some of the <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="131">lo-fi</span> fuzz that he&rsquo;s always been known for, but some careful layering of sounds gives <strong>Smoke Ring For My Halo</strong> real clarity and depth.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The answer is yes. Everyone with an interest in indie music, whether hobbyist, artist, label, or critic, wondered whether Justin Vernon could rekindle the morose magic that defined <strong>For Emma, Forever Ago</strong>. It was a stunning debut that palpably and genuinely reflected the emotion derived from its creator&rsquo;s circumstances. But those circumstances were, well, circumstantial. The &ldquo;bon <span word="hiver”" data-scaytid="139">hiver&rdquo;</span> had passed, and Vernon emerged from the woods with passionate fans, opportunities for A-list collaborations, and considerably more resources for a follow-up that would be hyped to the max. A sophomore slump would have been understandable, even expected. But no, Vernon exercised discretion. He extricated <strong>Emma</strong>&rsquo;s kernel of greatness and fortified it with a broader sound and more ambitious instrumentation using a full band. Lyricism on <strong>Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="138">Iver</span></strong> suffers a bit, toeing the line between abstract and plain unintelligible, but mood is the clear focal point here. <strong>Bon <span word="Iver" data-scaytid="141">Iver</span></strong> is as desolate as it is delicate, haunting and <span word="hibernal" data-scaytid="143">hibernal</span>. It is what we all hoped it would be: one of the year&rsquo;s best albums. (Ben Jones)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lyrically, Annie Clark opened up a lot more on <strong>Strange Mercy</strong> than its predecessor, <strong>Actor</strong>, but strangely for an undeniably more personal record, the results are more expansive than they are inverted. Fuller, richer and more varied; from the irresistible and intoxicating pop delights of Cruel to the delicate and beautiful laments of the title track. Her voice cloaked in character and humble beauty, coupled with more experimental sonic leanings, the results are a consistent delight. Even the closing tale of depression, <em>Year of the Tiger</em>, is somehow rousing in its delivery, as though it&rsquo;s closing a period in her life that one presumes and hopes she has now overcome.

Instead, for this long-gestating effort the songs have become more personal, dealing with loneliness and the grieving aftermath of a broken relationship.

High points in this thoroughly satisfying record are <em><span word="Lorelai" data-scaytid="147">Lorelai</span></em>, the two-tiered title song, and <em>The Shrine/An Argument</em>, whose mid-song jazz <span word="skronk" data-scaytid="148">skronk</span> suggests that this group will continue to surprise us.

<div>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the inevitable bastardization of <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="149">dubstep</span> had to happen so soon &ndash; it was the year for club promoters, hack DJs, and hard liqueur sponsors to maximize profit by trivializing its ethos to nothing more than mindless build-ups and gratuitous touchy-feely. Aside from all that, a nascent UK producer by the name of James Blake dared to give some soul while tipping his hat to the well-respected purveyors of the genre. What&rsquo;s noteworthy about <strong>James Blake</strong> is that it adds substance to a brand that is mostly appreciated for its abstract workflow process. But truly, Blake&rsquo;s strength lies in how he articulates a tangible quality through all the cutting and splicing &ndash; even when he re-shifts his voice (which is commanding in its own right), inch by inch, it conveys the sparse, yet layered metronomic arrangements with an underlying sense of seclusion. Once the gospel tinged <em>Measurements </em>triumphantly closes with barely a murmur, you&rsquo;ve officially converted to Blake&rsquo;s synthesized rapture.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Let England Shake</strong>&nbsp;is a staggeringly bold and ambitious work, which manages to make an array of political and anti-war statements without ever descending into the realm of <span word="preachiness" data-scaytid="167">preachiness</span>. It&#39;s not even a stretch to suggest that Harvey&#39;s lyrics constitute some of the finest war poetry of the current century. <strong>Let England Shake</strong> alludes to a string of conflicts involving British troops spanning nearly 100 years, from <span word="Gallipoli" data-scaytid="168">Gallipoli</span> in World War I (<em>All And Everyone</em>) to Afghanistan (<em>The Words That <span word="Maketh" data-scaytid="169">Maketh</span> Murder</em>). There is a strong critical voice present throughout, which is most evident in <em>The Last Living Rose</em> (&quot;the grey, damp filthiness of ages&quot;) and <em>The Glorious Land</em> (&quot;our land is <span word="ploughed" data-scaytid="172">ploughed</span> by tanks and feet&quot;), but the line that resonates most deeply with me comes from standout track <em>The Words That <span word="Maketh" data-scaytid="170">Maketh</span> Murder</em>. As Harvey declares &quot;I&#39;ve seen and done things I want to forget; I&#39;ve seen a corporal whose nerves were shot&quot;, I am acutely reminded of the lasting impact of modern warfare on the mental health of those involved. While the Afghan War has been raging for over ten years, there has been a distinct lack of comment on the conflict (and politics in a wider sense) from within the musical community. This is nothing short of disgraceful. There will always be plenty of room for songs about love, sex and hedonism, but we also need records of <strong>Let England Shake</strong>&#39;s <span word="calibre" data-scaytid="174">calibre</span> once in a while, if for no other reason than to remind us that there are bigger things in life than the coming weekend.&nbsp;(David Coleman)</div>
