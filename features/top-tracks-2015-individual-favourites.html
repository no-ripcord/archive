  <div>We&rsquo;ve all got our tracks from 2015 that we feel didn&rsquo;t get the attention they deserved. That&rsquo;s why, ahead of our tracks of the year list, we&rsquo;re shining a light on the songs that need a bit of extra love. Maybe their selection here will lead to the plaudits they merit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/1.jpg" /><strong><span word="Gunship" data-scaytid="1">Gunship</span></strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Tech Noir&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from <span word="“Gunship”" data-scaytid="2">&ldquo;Gunship&rdquo;</span> on <span word="Ingrooves" data-scaytid="3">Ingrooves</span>)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&rsquo;m a pretty big fan of retro synthesizer soundtracks, especially ones with walls of pulsating synthesizers and reverb-soaked drum machines. So <em>Tech Noir</em>, with its <span word="80s" data-scaytid="4">80s</span> production polish, John Carpenter voice-over, and gear shifting sound effects is easy for me to latch onto. However, while nostalgia certainly seems to be the most immediate appeal of <em>Tech Noir</em>, it is ultimately excellent <span word="song-smithing" data-scaytid="5">song-smithing</span> that propels it forward. With that said, it is tragically hard to find an appropriate setting to properly listen to <em>Tech Noir</em>, as neon-blazoned discotheques have been out of fashion in America since the late 1980s. However, if you live in an apartment adorned with blacklight posters of sci-fi blockbusters and illuminated by an arsenal of laser lights, then you are in luck! <em>Andrew Ciraulo</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/2.jpg" /><strong>FFS</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Collaborations Don&rsquo;t Work&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;FFS&rdquo; on Domino Records)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They do, especially when both bands shine and the work stands alongside the best they produced. This track is the highlight of the <strong>FFS </strong>album, combining techno, glam rock, comic opera vocals, and intense classical piano. Fun is the objective here, and it&#39;s highly contagious, with every line a gem: <em>&ldquo;Mozart didn&#39;t need a hack to chart / Warhol didn&#39;t ask De Kooning about art.&rdquo; </em>The transitions between styles are smooth and all the melodies are catchy. Every stab from the Maels (<em>&ldquo;I don&#39;t need your navel gazing&rdquo;</em>), gets a sharp riposte from Alex Kapranos (<em>&ldquo;If I ever need a father, it won&#39;t be you, old man&rdquo;</em>), each treading the edge of magnificent absurdity. This feast of wit arrived just in time to lighten this gloomy year. <em>Angel Aguilar</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/3.jpg" /><strong>Joanna Newsom</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Goose Eggs&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;Divers&rdquo; on Drag City)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Divers </strong>may be Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s best album yet, in no small part because it cuts down on the meandering, shapeless quality of much of her earlier work. The beginning of <em>Goose Eggs</em>, an interplay between electric piano and borderline-medieval harpsichord, threatens to drift off in this direction. Luckily, the song quickly falls into an established rhythm, one that strikes a balance between complexity and tight construction as well as any song in her catalogue. Ironically, the characters in her song can&rsquo;t seem to stop meandering, though here it&rsquo;s part of a moving search for connection and the feeling of belonging. Newsom makes it a matter of both where we are and whom we&rsquo;re there with, singing, <em>&ldquo;I had better find my way to being the kind of friend you need in me.&rdquo;</em> <strong>Divers </strong>represents a new place for Newsom, but this song proves she&rsquo;s found her peace there. <em>Brad&nbsp;Hanford</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/4.jpg" /><strong>Wolf Alice</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Giant Peach&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;My Love is Cool&rdquo; on Dirty Hit)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Wolf Alice have had an incredible year. <strong>My Love Is Cool </strong>was one of the most eagerly anticipated British debuts in a long time, dropping in June with a ridiculous amount of strings to its bow. One of those strings was a feral, frosty psycho-grunge track that exuded swagger and a callous brand of cool. <em>Giant Peach </em>snakes out of the blocks amidst a drenching of feedback. The track advances intently, with a razor-sharp drum skit and a stinging, devious chug providing the foundations for Ellie Rowsell&rsquo;s thorny-sweet vocal to revel in its danger. There&rsquo;s also one of the biggest riffs of the year in here, with the track only finishing once that riff has robbed you blind. A genuine monster of a track. <em>Carl Purvis</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/5.jpg" /><strong>KDA</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Rumble (Shadow Child re-edit)&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(stand-alone single on Ministry of Sound)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a passionate fan of house music, there are few things that frustrate me more than when an artist or record label chooses to plaster ill-fitting vocals onto a well-crafted underground track, seemingly only to make it more commercially successful. In 2014, the biggest victim of this was Oliver Heldens&rsquo; <em>Gecko</em>. This year, the award goes to London-based Kris Di Angelis&rsquo; (aka KDA) <em>Rumble (Shadow Child re-edit)</em> (subsequently renamed <em>Turn The Music Louder</em>). For those only familiar with the painful re-work featuring a certain Mr. T Tempah and one Ms. K Brien, I beg you to listen to the track which inspired it. Its joyously repetitive, infectious melody may end up embedding something of a permanent earworm but it&rsquo;s worth it to enjoy one of the very best pieces of house music 2015 had to offer. <em>Craig Stevens</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/6.jpg" /><strong>Of Montreal</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Empyrean Abattoir&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;Aureate Gloom&rdquo; on Polyvinyl)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>New Of Montreal music wasn&#39;t exactly top of my 2015 wish-list, so credit must go to Kevin Barnes and company for turning my ambivalence into a temporary obsession in less than five minutes. <em>Empyrean Abattoir</em> bears all of the hallmarks of the band&#39;s finest work, while also including several traits of its worst, presumably to remind you that you&#39;re still listening to Of Montreal. While I&#39;m tempted to award them a bonus mark for including &#39;abattoir&#39; in the title, I simply can&#39;t turn a blind eye to the fact it&#39;s preceded by the word &#39;empyrean&#39;. Some artists, it seems, will never learn. <em>David Coleman</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/7.jpg" /><strong>Sleater-Kinney</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Bury Our Friends&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;No Cities To Love&rdquo; on Sub Pop)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Bury Our Friends </em>isn&rsquo;t the obvious choice from Sleater-Kinney&#39;s astonishing 2015 release, <strong>No Cities to Love</strong>. Still, for me, this anthem epitomises the album&rsquo;s very core, the concept of rebirth after a decade apart. Starting out a bit calmer, <em>&quot;Like some doll you thought you could throw away / I found my legs,&quot; </em>the song crescendos into a march, a call to arms: <em>&quot;Exhume our idols and bury our friends / We&#39;re wild and weary but we won&#39;t give in / We&#39;re sick with worry / These nervous days / We live on dread in our own gilded age.&quot; </em>This isn&#39;t just a renaissance. It&#39;s a chthonic birth from the bowels of the earth breaking painfully free back into a completely different universe. After ten years of starvation, <em>&quot;untamed and hungry,&quot;</em> <em>&quot;wild and weary,&quot;</em> they return to give if not the best recording of 2015, at least my top pick. <em>Gabbie Nirenburg</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/8.jpg" /><strong>Deniro Farrar</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Nostalgia&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;Guilty Until Proven Innocent EP&rdquo; on Warner Bros.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&rsquo;m not from North Carolina, I&rsquo;m from a tiny town in England. Deniro Farrar and I have lived very different lives. Great art unites, and despite having next to nothing in common with the guy, Deniro Farrar forms a personal connection. Tapping into the rich vein of familial raps, <em>Nostalgia </em>is a Dirty South version of Proust, the story of a new father trying to make sense of his childhood. It captures the bipolar view we have of the past, wishing it were different but missing it so much, with a series of recollections that we can all recognise. Riding bikes with your friends, a relative with cancer, a mother doing everything she can; it&rsquo;s happened to all of us, shaped us. Each hazy verse is backed by a dream-like, Dilla-style beat, encouraging wistful glances out the window. Have a listen, shed a tear, look back. <em>James McKenna</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/9.jpg" /><strong>Foals</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;What Went Down&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;What Went Down&rdquo; on Warner Bros.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the opening notes of <em>What Went Down</em>, it&#39;s clear that Foals are on a take-no-prisoners mission. More direct and more aggressive than anything in their catalogue so far, this single is a blast of fuzzed-out guitar riffs and ragged vocals. During the verses, the call and response of vocals and chords simulate a predator chasing its prey. <em>&quot;When I see a man, I see a liar,&quot; </em>shouts Yannis Philippakis for the chorus, as the music savagely pounces. Then there&#39;s the wonderful keyboard-laden bridge, which brings a chanting, almost spiritual touch to the number. While older songs like <em>Inhaler </em>hinted at Foals&#39; combativeness, <em>What Went Down </em>puts it front and centre as a bold-faced, all-caps battle cry. <em>Joe Marvilli</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/10.jpg" /><strong>Bill Wells &amp; Aidan Moffat</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Any Other Mirror&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;The Most Important Place in the World&rdquo; on Chemikal Underground)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Despite making his name with youthful tales of excess and regret, Aidan Moffat actually suits domesticity better. Pop music is obsessed with the first flushes of lust, but on <em>Any Other Mirror</em>, Moffat poignantly observes the teamwork, understanding and unconditional love that comes from a committed long-term relationship. It isn&rsquo;t all picnics on the beach and spontaneity; it runs much deeper than that, even if the order of the day sometimes has to be housework and paying the bills. Atop Bill Wells&rsquo; understated, slinky Latin percussion, warm brass and jazz-influenced piano chords, Moffat imparts the universal truth: <em>&ldquo;I might be a useless prick / But I feel ugly, old and thick / In any other mirror but you.&rdquo; </em>Moffat has a unique gift in turning the vulgar into the poetic, and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever related to a lyric more. <em>Joe Rivers</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/11.jpg" /><strong>A$AP Rocky</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Excuse Me&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;At.Long.Last.A$AP&rdquo; on RCA Records)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Given A$AP Rocky&rsquo;s heavy fixation with hallucinogens in <strong>At.Long.Last.A$AP</strong>, it only makes sense that <em>Excuse Me </em>unfolds like an imaginary dreamland where he&rsquo;s the conductor of a warped Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical. Nevertheless, traces of Rocky&rsquo;s brash ego are ever-present, displayed with blunt specificity verse by verse, rapping a string of disconnected thoughts as if he&rsquo;s dived headfirst into a nebulous, paranoid robo-trip. Naturally, it augments Rocky&rsquo;s arrogance tenfold, demanding the respect he thinks he deserves without giving his naysayers the chance to even the score. It&rsquo;s Lord Flacko in full regal costume, and given the track&rsquo;s grand opulence, his place in the throne is rightfully secured and shouldn&rsquo;t be threatened. <em>Juan Edgardo Rodriguez</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/12.jpg" /><strong>Shura</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;White Light&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(stand-alone single on Bsessi Limited)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Shura&rsquo;s rise through the ranks in 2015 has happened at a pace that&rsquo;s been less meteoric, more absurd. No doubt this will result in a backlash questioning the hype just around the time that she gets around to releasing an album, but so far, what Shura&rsquo;s rapid development has provided us with is a steady succession of exceptional singles. Each one has been perfectly fine-tuned and fiercely calibrated, but also entirely filled with giddy excitement and breathy anticipation, of which, <em>White Light </em>might be the giddiest. Released at the start of June, the track&rsquo;s combination of tastefully crafted, 80s Madonna-leaning guitar and synths, an endearingly silly sci-fi theme and sweeping bubblegum chorus made it a perfect summer soundtrack. One that was ideally suited for both festival crowds and just hitting the open road (or hitching a ride in a spaceship) and taking off into the great blue yonder. <em>Mark Davison</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/13.jpg" /><strong>Majical Cloudz</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Downtown&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;Are You Alone?&rdquo; on Matador Records)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Devon Welsh&rsquo;s lyrics have traditionally seemed to come from the darkest depths of his heart, which is why the initial sweetness of <em>Downtown </em>is so immediately arresting in the context of Majical Cloudz&rsquo; music. <em>Downtown </em>is largely Welsh&rsquo;s best attempt at capturing the joy of not being alone in the moment, holding the hands of a loved one in busy city streets and wondering, <em>&ldquo;Is it really this cool to be in your life?&rdquo; </em>Even when the cloudz do roll in and Welsh begins to wonder if the feeling won&rsquo;t last, there&rsquo;s an endearing optimism that even in the worst case scenario, some good will come. It seems foolish, but what <em>Downtown </em>conveys is that in the face of uncertainty, when something so beautiful is in your grasp, maybe a little wide-eyed optimism is all we have to keep things together. <em>Peter Quinton</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><img align="left" height="150" hspace="5" src="../files/2015/tracks/14.jpg" /></p>
<div><strong>Hop Along</strong></div>
<div><em>&ldquo;Happy to See Me&rdquo;</em></div>
<div>(from &ldquo;Painted Shut&rdquo; on Saddle Creek)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To close out the first side of their near-perfect indie rock album <strong>Painted Shut</strong>, Hop Along&#39;s frontwoman Frances Quinlan strips it back to an acoustic guitar and a harp, and lets her throaty, acrobatic vocals completely let go. The song&#39;s first line, <em>&quot;Trying to change my mind about how everything went&quot;</em>, is pithily poignant, transferable and intensely relatable. In the song&#39;s second half she repeats the line, <em>&quot;We all will remember things the same way&quot;</em>, until she&#39;s screaming at the top of her voice - it takes her recurrent lyrical theme of collective affect and the irony of the gap between self and self-perception to desperate extremes, and it pretty much reduces me to a puddle. <em>Stephen Wragg</em></div>
