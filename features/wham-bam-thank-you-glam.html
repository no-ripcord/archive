  <p><a href="../reviews/music/david-bowie/next-day.html"><strong>The Next Day</strong></a><span style="line-height: 20px;"> is David Bowie&rsquo;s </span><span data-scayt_word="26th" data-scaytid="136">26th</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> studio album, a high point in a rich career that dates back to the mid </span><span data-scayt_word="‘60s" data-scaytid="137">&lsquo;60s</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">. Since then, he&rsquo;s adopted myriad personas and taken his fans through some thrilling musical journeys. Few have been as exciting as his glam-star period. It is conceivable that he would still find a place in the pop pantheon without </span><span data-scayt_word="tarting" data-scaytid="138">tarting</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> himself up as </span><span data-scayt_word="Ziggy" data-scaytid="139">Ziggy</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> Stardust, but glam would have been a less significant scene without his moon-age </span><span data-scayt_word="aesthetic" data-scaytid="140">aesthetic</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">. Of course, Bowie wasn&rsquo;t alone in creating this pop-culture explosion. It all started when Marc </span><span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="141">Bolan</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> stood up and plugged in his guitar, but I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">In 1970, the music business was centered in California, and albums outsold singles. </span><span data-scayt_word="Psychedelia" data-scaytid="142">Psychedelia</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> had faded and there was a new rush for singer-songwriter gold among the big record companies. Artists like The Beatles wanted to get back to simpler times, yet first-generation rockers like Little Richard and Bo </span><span data-scayt_word="Diddley" data-scaytid="143">Diddley</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> were relegated to revival shows. Dylan went country for a while, British groups were meddling with concept albums and rock operas, and the first strains of </span><span data-scayt_word="prog-rock" data-scaytid="144">prog-rock</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> were spreading like a plague. Woodstock marked </span><span data-scayt_word="hippiedom’s" data-scaytid="145">hippiedom&rsquo;s</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> peak, with its images of naked kids playing in mud. Soon after, reality would hit hard with </span><span data-scayt_word="Altamont" data-scaytid="146">Altamont</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> and the Manson Family murders.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; there was some worthy music being produced back then. But any teenager rummaging through his sibling&rsquo;s record collection found dire disappointment. Something vital was missing in those ten-minute guitar jams: fun. Time was ripe for a generational change.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">Enter Marc </span><span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="147">Bolan</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> and T. Rex. </span><span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="148">Bolan</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> had just replaced Steve Peregrine Took, his percussionist partner, with Mickey Finn, an amiable fellow more receptive to his new musical agenda. On the outside, </span><span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="149">Bolan</span><span style="line-height: 20px;"> looked like any other flower child, but the inside was a cauldron of hot ambition. Being in a successful cult group was no success at all. Recently married, there was no joy in living in a cold-water flat. The time of playing for sandals-and-granola audiences was over.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">It was 1970: time to go all electric. <span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="150">Bolan</span> added bass and drums to the group, concocting <em>Ride A White Swan</em> with the help of producer Tony <span data-scayt_word="Visconti" data-scaytid="151">Visconti</span>, a delightful mixture of Tolkien and Eddie Cochran that went straight to number 2 in the charts. Its follow up, <em>Hot Love</em>, did even better. This was a rebooted blues for the space age, its chugging guitar and high-pitched chorus completing the T. Rex signature sound.</span></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9rFoPyqFoA" width="420"></iframe></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="152">Bolan</span> looked fine on television, with his long corkscrew hair and dabs of glitter under his eyes. A mod at heart, he was following a tradition of sartorial splendor learned from rock pioneers. To this tradition he added satin suits, top hats, boas, <span data-scayt_word="slingbacks" data-scaytid="153">slingbacks</span>, and whatever remained in his wife&rsquo;s closet. There was something sensual about his tremulous baritone voice. The youth of the day understood, and soon he had hordes of pubescent girls after him. T.Rextasy had begun.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;"><span data-scayt_word="Bolan’s" data-scaytid="154">Bolan&rsquo;s</span> old friend would soon overtake him. David Bowie had met <span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="155">Bolan</span> five years before, during the task of whitewashing the office of manager Les Conn, striking a friendship as they talked about clothes. As the <span data-scayt_word="‘70s" data-scaytid="156">&lsquo;70s</span> began, Bowie&rsquo;s career had stalled. He was being perceived as a one-hit wonder, but his <span data-scayt_word="songcraft" data-scaytid="157">songcraft</span> had become richer, drawing inspiration from unlikely sources such as Anthony Newly and The Velvet Underground. He also had the good fortune to meet Mick <span data-scayt_word="Ronson" data-scaytid="158">Ronson</span>, a classically trained musician who could play guitar like Jeff Beck and dash a string arrangement at the bat of an eyelash. When Bowie cut his hair and adopted the <span data-scayt_word="Ziggy" data-scaytid="159">Ziggy</span> persona, he had all the musical muscle behind him to transform the musical landscape.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">Bowie had his first glam hit with <em>Star Man</em>, but by then he was competing with other <span data-scayt_word="‘60s" data-scaytid="160">&lsquo;60s</span> <span data-scayt_word="also-rans" data-scaytid="161">also-rans</span> such as Gary Glitter (formerly known as Paul Raven) and Slade. Glitter&rsquo;s records had a thundering two-drums sound. Slade just had a drum kit but counted on Noddy Holder&rsquo;s <span data-scayt_word="Sensurround" data-scaytid="162">Sensurround</span> voice and the biggest stack of amps around to make noise. This was joyous foot-stomping music that sold records, and in the history of pop music all success is followed by formula. Nicky <span data-scayt_word="Chinn" data-scaytid="163">Chinn</span> and Mike Chapman came to the front as the producing-songwriting team behind acts such as The Sweet, <span data-scayt_word="Suzi" data-scaytid="164">Suzi</span> <span data-scayt_word="Quatro" data-scaytid="165">Quatro</span>, and Mud. The best of the bunch were The Sweet, hard rockers who resented their producers&rsquo; tight grip on the music. Out of this tension, some great songs were produced like <em>Ballroom Blitz</em> and <em>Blockbuster</em>.</span></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgrYf7VWASE" width="420"></iframe></p><p>Unlike their British counterparts, the New York Dolls were new to the scene. Guitarist <span data-scayt_word="Syl" data-scaytid="166">Syl</span> <span data-scayt_word="Sylvain" data-scaytid="167">Sylvain</span> had been in the clothing business, and the group had a style of their own, though the gender-bending makeup was only used for the cover of their first album. Their music was something else too. It was raw, fast, and in-your-face, setting the stage for punk. They caused a sensation in England when they played some engagements there in 1973. Roxy Music was another thoroughly original group that kept the glam fires stoked. With a mix of retro and futuristic styles, singles like <em>Virginia Plain</em> and <em><span data-scayt_word="Pyjamarama" data-scaytid="168">Pyjamarama</span> </em>were pop-art collages set to music.</p><p>Glam was the spirit of the times, and camp was in. Mick <span data-scayt_word="Jagger" data-scaytid="169">Jagger</span> started wearing <span data-scayt_word="spangly" data-scaytid="170">spangly</span> outfits and eyeliner, Elton John became pop&rsquo;s <span data-scayt_word="Liberace" data-scaytid="171">Liberace</span>, and Rod Stewart forced us to look away with his spandex trousers. It was cool to be gay or, at least, to hind that you might be.</p><p><strong><span data-scayt_word="Ziggy" data-scaytid="172">Ziggy</span> Stardust</strong> and <strong>Aladdin Sane</strong> cemented Bowie&rsquo;s hegemony, helping him make inroads in America, where <span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="173">Bolan</span> had failed. He was a catalyst who helped other artists regain their careers. Mott The <span data-scayt_word="Hoople" data-scaytid="174">Hoople</span> were an unlikely bunch to join in, but Bowie gave them <em>All The Young Dudes</em>, which became glam&rsquo;s anthem and inspired Ian Hunter to explore new ground as a songwriter. Bowie produced <span data-scayt_word="Iggy" data-scaytid="175">Iggy</span> and The Stooges&rsquo; <strong>Raw Power</strong> and rescued Lou Reed&rsquo;s career with <strong>Transformer</strong>. His visionary mind even foresaw the right moment to move on.</p><p>By 1974, the <span data-scayt_word="Chinnichap" data-scaytid="176">Chinnichap</span> groups were sounding stale. Bowie released <strong>Diamond Dogs</strong>, his glam <span data-scayt_word="swansong" data-scaytid="177">swansong</span>, a murky dystopian vision that left fans scratching their heads. <span data-scayt_word="Bolan" data-scaytid="178">Bolan</span> had become bloated, his career fueled only by his destructive ego, pushing family and friends away. When the hits stopped coming, he was running on empty, lacking a Plan B. It looked like curtains for glam.</p><p>The cultural climate was changing. New York and London, hubs for glam activity, were going through rough times, and flaunting your threads was now in bad taste. Bandwagon groups like Queen and Kiss kept distance from the scene, their sights set on global domination. It had become less about fun, more about commerce. Hedonism moved its base to the disco dance floor.</p><p>Glam never quite went away, though. Nothing else explains the rise of hair metal groups in the <span data-scayt_word="‘80s" data-scaytid="179">&lsquo;80s</span>, the outrageous glory of Prince, or Suede&rsquo;s success. Yet the real children of glam were the punks. Groups like the Dolls and Mott pointed the way, inspiring kids to form bands. There&rsquo;s no doubt Joey <span data-scayt_word="Ramone" data-scaytid="180">Ramone</span> and Mick Jones hid their old platform shoes in their closets.</p><p>Today, image rules. Every now and then there&rsquo;s a new dandy of the underworld, and <span data-scayt_word="multisexual" data-scaytid="181">multisexual</span> pop divas come a dime a dozen. All this vanity is fair, but the true legacy of glam goes beyond glitter and camp: it&rsquo;s the realization that at any point in your life you can reinvent yourself and start a new chapter. <em>&quot;Carry the news&hellip;&quot;</em></p>
