  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Behind The Candelabra: 6/10" alt="Rating - 6/10" src="../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/6.gif"/>
  <p>When Steven <span word="Soderbergh" data-scaytid="1">Soderbergh</span> first warned of retirement in 2009, he claimed he would finish what he was working on and then make a <span word="biopic" data-scaytid="2">biopic</span> entitled <strong><span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="3">Liberace</span></strong><em>, </em>a musical based about Cleopatra starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, and an adaptation of the <strong>The Sot-Weed Factor</strong>. When word got out again about his retirement, he was finishing up <em>Contagion</em> and it was decided he would complete <strong><span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="9">Liberace</span> </strong>and make an adaptation of the TV show &ldquo;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&rdquo; starring George Clooney, and that would be it. In addition to the eventual release of <strong>Haywire</strong> (filmed in 2010), <span word="Soderbergh" data-scaytid="11">Soderbergh</span> has since been talked into <strong>Magic Mike</strong> and decided to also direct <strong>The Bitter Pill</strong>, which became <strong>Side Effects</strong>, released earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong><span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="13">Liberace</span> </strong>has surfaced now as <strong>Behind The Candelabra</strong>, and based on the above history, which shows <span word="Soderbergh’s" data-scaytid="15">Soderbergh&rsquo;s</span> tendency to change his mind and be talked into new projects, it is probably more accurate to call it his &ldquo;latest&rdquo; film rather than his &ldquo;last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In any case, let&rsquo;s hope so, because most of <span word="Soderbergh’s" data-scaytid="16">Soderbergh&rsquo;s</span> work in the past five years is stronger than <strong>Behind The Candelabra</strong>, an enjoyable but somewhat less interesting note to go out on. To pull a few those that stand out most to be, <strong><span word="Che" data-scaytid="22">Che</span>&nbsp;</strong>is a <span word="biopic" data-scaytid="19">biopic</span> with twice the length of <strong>Candelabra</strong>, <strong>The Girlfriend Experience</strong> is a worthwhile experiment in editing and casting as well as a good portrait of recession-plagued America, <strong>Haywire</strong> is a smart deconstruction of the action genre, and <strong>Magic Mike</strong> is an intelligent and humorous look at opportunity in the age of post-American <span word="Exceptionalism" data-scaytid="26">Exceptionalism</span> with some great cinematography to boot. <strong>Candelabra</strong> has a pair of great performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon as <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="24">Liberace</span> and his decades-younger lover Scott <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="37">Thorson</span>, respectively, as well as a handful of expectedly-great costumes, but it&rsquo;s also much more comfortable in all other respects. It has been purported that the major studios all passed on it because of the homosexuality at its core, but <strong>Candelabra </strong>is far from explicit and certainly not groundbreaking in its depiction of homosexual sex or sexuality. In fact, the film has more than a little in common with Ira Sachs&rsquo; <strong>Keep The Lights On</strong>, another somewhat underwritten, one-sided relationship drama based on a memoir.</p>
<p>Where it succeeds is as a character study, not of the ordinary, somewhat money-grubbing <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="40">Thorson</span> but of the lonely <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="43">Liberace</span>, who surrounds himself with pets, servants, and lovers in an attempt to make a connection, all while hiding his sexuality from the public. We see his attempts to control <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="41">Thorson</span>, whose youthful <span word="naïveté" data-scaytid="54">naïveté</span> is the story&rsquo;s tragic flaw, and we are constrained to <span word="Thorson’s" data-scaytid="55">Thorson&rsquo;s</span> point of view to allow us to also side against <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="44">Liberace</span>, who probably cheats on <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="42">Thorson</span> through much of their relationship. The technique works, because even though it makes us side against <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="45">Liberace</span>, the film still effectively conveys his loneliness; everything he does, be it heavy touring and multiple shows a night or surgery and beautiful costuming (both clothing and hair) comes from a desire to be loved by a public who, should they uncover the truth, may stop loving him solely for prejudice. Almost all of this comes from Douglas&rsquo; portrayal, perhaps the sole humanizing factor in a story that emphasizes his manipulative tactics, as the script is a bit too intimate to take on <span word="Liberace’s" data-scaytid="56">Liberace&rsquo;s</span> external life in a more meaningful way. Thankfully, through Douglas, we can better understand how the external life is important and perhaps even sympathize with <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="46">Liberace</span>, all without having to condone his abusive actions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a heavy supply of black humor throughout the film that lets the mostly predictable, occasionally repetitive story move at a better pace. <span word="Aesthetically" data-scaytid="57">Aesthetically</span>, <strong>Candelabra </strong>is exactly what you would expect from <span word="Soderbergh" data-scaytid="58">Soderbergh</span>. Like many of his more recent films, it has a heavy orange tint and, as in <strong>Magic Mike</strong>, finds a drug-induced sequence to change things up a bit. While the corresponding scene in <strong>Magic Mike </strong>was a somewhat forced break that distracted from the music-video <span word="aesthetic" data-scaytid="61">aesthetic</span>, it&rsquo;s much more welcome here, the darker subject matter calling for unhinged moments of risk. It&rsquo;s a shame that there is only one, as <span word="Soderbergh’s" data-scaytid="60">Soderbergh&rsquo;s</span> cinematography, in its less successful ventures, is more distinctive than it is evocative, and <strong>Candelabra</strong> treads the line when it should fall quite firmly on the better side.</p>
<p>In its final moments, which stretch out ever-so-slightly, <strong>Candelabra </strong>makes a rushed plea for the importance of gay marriage, and the final shots, of <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="63">Thorson</span> watching a show in which <span word="Liberace" data-scaytid="65">Liberace</span> floats onto and off of the stage, are a bit sour, almost counter-productive. When <span word="Thorson" data-scaytid="64">Thorson</span> finally appears to have learned he suddenly seems to be reeled back into <span word="Liberace’s" data-scaytid="66">Liberace&rsquo;s</span> perverse game, years later. One could call it a reminder of love and the happy times, but in that case, it&rsquo;s hard to see it as anything other than a bittersweet <span word="cliché" data-scaytid="72">cliché</span> in a story that we can already see coming from the beginning. Some forgiveness could be leveraged, as the film is based on <span word="Thorson’s" data-scaytid="67">Thorson&rsquo;s</span> own memoir, but regardless, a repetitive cycle enlivened by <span word="aesthetics" data-scaytid="74">aesthetics</span> less than it should be makes <strong>Candelabra </strong>an enjoyable but somewhat lacking look at a rich subject, saved primarily by Michael Douglas&rsquo; great performance.</p>
