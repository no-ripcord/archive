  <p>Steve James&#39; inflated commemoration of the late Roger Ebert is brimming with such a wealth of documentation, archival footage, and eulogizing voices that it&#39;s as disorderly and unfocused as it is a moving tribute to one of most lauded figures in film criticism (who initially <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hoop-dreams-1994">championed</a> the very filmmaker some two decades ago).&nbsp; Aptly, Ebert&#39;s first words in the production are lifted from a July 2005 speech about movies acting as &quot;a machine that generates empathy... help[<span word="ing" data-scaytid="1">ing</span>] us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.&quot;&nbsp; Indicative of Ebert&#39;s &quot;relative, not absolute&quot; approach to criticism, he firmly believed everyone should be able to understand the presentation of a film, even if it this noble crusade often appeared to be impractical.&nbsp; This quote&#39;s prominence seems self-congratulatory in the context of James&#39; film, as if predetermining its own emotional resonance.&nbsp; <strong>Life Itself</strong> successfully humanizes Ebert&#39;s various complications through his nearly fifty-year career, but for a movie documentary concerning the critic of the medium, James seems to obscure Ebert&#39;s everlasting effect by continually tampering with the audience&#39;s emotional centers to the point of exhaustion.&nbsp; Humorous anecdotes of Ebert&#39;s youth as well as heated banter between Ebert and inseparable rival/television partner Gene <span word="Siskel" data-scaytid="2">Siskel</span> are dispersed with melancholic accounts of other colleagues and family.&nbsp; Due to its expansive length and focus, <strong>Life Itself</strong> earns its title separate from Ebert&#39;s memoir of the same name.&nbsp; Yet the restless structure and emotional oscillations often scatter rather than zoom in on Ebert&#39;s life even if James anchors the film with a demanding look at his medical ordeal during a December 2012 hospital stay after a femur fracture.</p>
<p>Although Ebert is a film critic now more recognized by his distinctively hearty voice, portly appearance, and trademarked &quot;thumbs up,&quot; the film provides a suitable counterbalance by incorporating excerpts from his memoir and film columns; subbing as Ebert&#39;s voice is actor Stephen Stanton, who recites passages from his appraisals of <strong>Bonnie and Clyde </strong>(1967), <strong>Cries and Whispers</strong> (1973), and <strong>The Tree of Life</strong> (2011), among others.&nbsp; The words nostalgically materialize at random points on the screen and vanish quickly as if James is attempting to revive his physical presence through visual effect.&nbsp; Ebert&#39;s leap from page to television screens of millions of Americans is the most pointed aspect of his career, but it somehow feels lopsidedly represented in the ongoing brotherly feud with <em>Chicago Tribune</em> critic, <span word="Siskel" data-scaytid="3">Siskel</span>.&nbsp; Working his way up to most famous contributor for <em>The Chicago Sun-Times</em> in the late <span word="1970s" data-scaytid="6">1970s</span>, Ebert was then propositioned to do a public-access television show with <span word="Siskel" data-scaytid="5">Siskel</span>, who literally worked across the street.&nbsp; From the beginning, there existed an animosity (and bad fashion sense) between the writers and their respective demographics, which transferred to the complex dynamic between them on-screen.&nbsp; From Gene&#39;s articulate air to Roger&#39;s sharp sarcasm, audiences came to admire their unique and uncompromising charisma.&nbsp; James pinpoints this through the inclusion of a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkwVz_jK3gA">TV spot rehearsals</a> in which the co-hosts ad-lib to promote their various takes on the week&#39;s cinema block.&nbsp; These charged moments are both amusing and revealing, suggesting the biggest attraction for viewers was often not their preexisting reputations but rather their &quot;transgressive&quot; arguments as a result of their alpha personalities.&nbsp; Despite his on-screen confidence, as television producer <span word="Thea" data-scaytid="8">Thea</span> <span word="Flaum" data-scaytid="9">Flaum</span> notes, Ebert needed to adapt to the more conversational format despite his own boasting that he had a Pulitzer on his mantle for the written word.</p>
<p>Finding comfort in a screen presence, Ebert&#39;s heft as a pundit became more tangible over the decades as the television show changed names and networks; despite backlash from <em>Time Magazine </em>writer Richard <span word="Corliss" data-scaytid="11">Corliss</span> who claimed <span word="Siskel" data-scaytid="10">Siskel</span> and Ebert&#39;s show was cursory and oversimplified, Ebert ignored naysayers and embraced new creative visions that matched his own progressive ambition and reverence for the film medium.&nbsp; Several filmmakers appear in <strong>Life Itself</strong> to return his kind words, as Ebert elevated their independent works to national attention.&nbsp; Errol Morris is most significant with his <a href="gates-heaven.html"><strong>Gates of Heaven</strong></a> (1978) documentary about California pet cemeteries.&nbsp; &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have a career without him,&quot; he remarks.&nbsp; Others include <span word="Ramin" data-scaytid="13">Ramin</span> <span word="Bahrani" data-scaytid="14">Bahrani</span> with his <span word="neorealist-new" data-scaytid="15">neorealist-new</span> wave fusion flick, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/man-push-cart-2006"><strong>Man Push Cart</strong></a> (2005), and Ava <span word="DuVernay&#039;s" data-scaytid="17">DuVernay&#39;s</span> affecting drama of love and loss, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-will-follow-2011"><strong>I Will Follow</strong></a> (2011).&nbsp; By the end of his illustrious career, Ebert claims to have seen 10,000 films while reviewing about sixty percent of that total.&nbsp; Particularly in the latter half of the documentary, James turns away from public achievement to more pressing private memories, which equally expose his successes and failures.&nbsp; <span word="Chaz" data-scaytid="18">Chaz</span>, Ebert&#39;s devoted wife of twenty-one years, who he first met at an AA meeting, details her husband&#39;s perseverance in the face of various setbacks.&nbsp; With her detailed reminiscences, however, the film acquires a greater habit of skipping through personal and professional voices; while they are indicative of Ebert&#39;s far-reaching connections and impact, some of the accounts feel a bit speculative and superfluous.&nbsp; <span word="Bahrani" data-scaytid="16">Bahrani</span> exhibits a jigsaw puzzle bestowed upon him, tracing its origins to Alfred Hitchcock; digressions into Ebert&#39;s activities at a &#39;<span word="70s" data-scaytid="20">70s</span> Cannes Film Festival feel like footnotes rather than true points of interest.&nbsp; And the final harrowing portion of the documentary is allocated solely to Ebert&#39;s deteriorating state with thyroid cancer, which is somewhat manipulative.&nbsp; However, with this empathetic glimpse, <strong>Life Itself </strong>achieves what no mere text could, perhaps as Ebert himself found success, in the real-time presence of one who endures.</p>
