  <p>In a loving way, watching Woody Allen&rsquo;s latest feature <em>Midnight in Paris</em> in 2011 is evocative of his black-and-white masterpiece <em>Manhattan </em>(1979).&nbsp; Pardon the absence of Allen&rsquo;s narration in the former, the films&rsquo; nearly identical opening montages are animated by the beautifully widescreen images of the respective locales.&nbsp; As <span word="Gershwin’s" data-scaytid="1">Gershwin&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;Rhapsody in Blue&rdquo; scored shots of <em>Manhattan</em>, New Orleans native Sidney <span word="Bechet&#039;s" data-scaytid="2">Bechet&#39;s</span> &ldquo;Si <span word="Tu" data-scaytid="3">Tu</span> <span word="Vois" data-scaytid="4">Vois</span> Ma <span word="Mère”" data-scaytid="5">Mère&rdquo;</span> adorns Allen&rsquo;s latest promenade through the city of love.&nbsp; In this three-minute sequence perfectly synchronized with song, Allen rediscovers the same sort of fondness for milieu and personal definition of place as he once did for his home.&nbsp; The <em>Manhattan </em>connection extends to the iconic promotional shots for the films, which portend the foci from the relationship ensemble to the individual: Isaac and Mary await the dawn and lounge on a bench near the <span word="Queensborough" data-scaytid="6">Queensborough</span> Bridge in <em>Manhattan</em>, and <em>Midnight in Paris</em> frames his protagonist strolling along the Seine as Van Gogh&rsquo;s <em>Starry Night</em> morphs the landscape into watercolor.&nbsp; As if writing a role for himself, the writer-director channels love for Paris through surrogate voice and Pasadena screenwriter Gil <span word="Pender" data-scaytid="7">Pender</span> (Owen Wilson &ndash; not the most believable Californian with his Southern accent), who is visiting with his girlfriend Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her well-to-do conservative parents.&nbsp; Gil&rsquo;s nostalgic pining for the past immediately intrudes upon the brief opening credits, and the subject of &ldquo;Golden Age Thinking&rdquo; is subsequently introduced as the thematic point for the film.&nbsp; Much like Allen, Gil openly romanticizes the past and affinity for early twentieth century writers (Hemingway) and music (Cole Porter).&nbsp; As the signature emotionally conflicted, insightful, self-deprecating intellectual, he transplants elements of a bygone era into his own unique modern artistic sensibility.&nbsp; In <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, Allen even extends this idea a step further in a sort of <em>Purple Rose of Cairo</em>-fashion, relocating Gil via low fantasy/magical realism/historical fiction into the warm inviting nights of <span word="1920s" data-scaytid="8">1920s</span>, the decade to which he most prominently identifies.</p>
<p>Adopting further elements from 1985&rsquo;s charming <em>Purple Rose of Cairo</em>, Allen circumvents rational explanations for his brand of pervading fantasy; he seeks to entertain through the portrait of a man, his city, and his ideals.&nbsp; <em>Midnight in Paris</em> achieves a relative balance in its presence of living historical figures by offering neither skeletal, overdeveloped, nor erroneous renderings; while the film falters somewhat from the revolving door of faces, they aren&rsquo;t permitted to usurp Gil&rsquo;s introspection.&nbsp; Among others, making appearances are Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald (a spontaneous Alison Pill and mannerly Tom <span word="Hiddleston" data-scaytid="9">Hiddleston</span>), Ernest Hemingway (a sportive Corey <span word="Stoll" data-scaytid="10">Stoll</span>), Gertrude Stein (a subdued Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (a cryptic <span word="Marcial" data-scaytid="11">Marcial</span> Di <span word="Fonzo" data-scaytid="12">Fonzo</span> Bo), Salvador Dali (a snide-looking <span word="Adrien" data-scaytid="13">Adrien</span> Brody), who are each played with varying degrees of success, but the importance is derived not from their mere on-screen time but Gil&rsquo;s collective interactions with them.&nbsp; Whether lightly humorous or meditative, each facilitates his epiphany.&nbsp; This is well-complemented by Gil&rsquo;s interactions in the present with anyone from Inez&rsquo;s peers to Parisians and the perceptions of success, career, romantic competitiveness &ndash; this longing for a past as the symbol of creative inspiration.&nbsp; Escorted to this magical realm of Paris by vintage Peugeot at the stroke of midnight, Gil happens upon a lovely and enigmatic young model/fashion student from Bordeaux, Adrianna (Marion <span word="Cotillard" data-scaytid="14">Cotillard</span>), at Gertrude Stein&rsquo;s abode.&nbsp; She is revealed to be Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s mistress (as Allen would seem to imply that her beauty cannot be contained to one man), who is intrigued by the introductory expounding of Gil&rsquo;s novel about the owner of an antique shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status once magical and also camp&hellip;,&rdquo;&nbsp; Stein reads aloud to attentive ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m already hooked,&rdquo; Adrianna responds.&nbsp; &ldquo;The past has always had a great charisma for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Drawn to the same <span word="romanticization" data-scaytid="15">romanticization</span> he himself possesses, Gil is enraptured by her nostalgic glamor.&nbsp; Although ironically flawed, Gil projects his hopeful, idealized love of Paris onto Adrianna, and she becomes the sort of mystical personification of the city.&nbsp; However, as Gil soon realizes, his love for a city of yore and woman that would surely be unfaithful to him within it is an &ldquo;insurmountable problem,&rdquo; as may be his superficial love for his beautiful but equally distracted belle, Inez.&nbsp; With this, Allen directs the familiar artist&rsquo;s dilemma toward a practical yet unexpected denouement.</p>
<p>Nagging questions pursue &ndash; cinematic redundancy (utilizing a writer who closely uses biographical elements for their fiction like Holly in <em>Hannah and Her Sisters</em> and Harry in <em>Deconstructing Harry</em>), Gil&rsquo;s inability to speak French despite his love for Paris, invisible modern technology, and the indirect dead-end jabs at modern fascism, ahem, conservatism &ndash; but they are relegated in light of the intelligible layering of commentaries of the creative mind.&nbsp; In respect to Allen&rsquo;s oeuvre, the revelation that nostalgia is inherently illusory is thematically refreshing, as if the director himself has turned a corner.&nbsp; It is diametrically opposed to his expected <span word="contemplations" data-scaytid="16">contemplations</span> in many of his former forty films, which regard high art of mid-twentieth century above anything of the present.&nbsp; Harking back to the <em>Manhattan </em>connection, Leonard Quart&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Woody Allen&rsquo;s New York,&rdquo; discusses the choice black-and-white cinematography of that film, which &ldquo;projects the city&rsquo;s continuity with, from his perspective, its more elegant past.&rdquo;&nbsp; By contrast, <em>Midnight in Paris</em> is filmed in color, because the triumphant view is inverted, and Gil as well as Allen embrace the present.&nbsp; Simon Gallagher of <em>Film School Rejects</em> <a href="http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/reviews/cannes-2011-review-midnight-in-paris.php">writes</a>, &ldquo;artists and &lsquo;real people&rsquo; are perpetually looking backwards enviously to what they see as a supposedly better time,&rdquo; using this escapism to stagnate the identity crises and clandestine cultural dilemmas throughout history.&nbsp; <em>Midnight in Paris</em> may also be seen as a continuing critique of the artistic vapidity that results from inclusion or ascension into high society; for the informed artist, material wealth means nothing in the absence of self-fulfillment.&nbsp; This is doubled by the inherent condemnation toward Inez&rsquo;s sporadically appearing, &ldquo;pedantic,&rdquo; former love-interest, Paul.&nbsp; The resulting and typically Allenesque message concerns forms of self-criticism that elevate one above the lifeless savant.&nbsp; Finally, <em>The Man From Porlock</em> <a href="https://themanfromporlock.blogspot.com/2011/06/past-imperfect-midnight-in-paris.html">lobs a complaint</a> about the director&rsquo;s dismissing of &ldquo;a potential comic goldmine by not having Inez go back with Gil and interact with his idols.&rdquo;&nbsp; While it would enhance her humanity, this trick would automatically force the core of the story to make a trite detour.&nbsp; Because Gil is acquainted with the essence of his idols through their work, the story maintains its individualistic integrity.&nbsp; Allen opts for more erudite humor involving Gil&rsquo;s interactions with historical figures through his seemingly prophetic knowledge of modern day (a scene with Luis Buñuel as possibly the best example).&nbsp; After all, it&rsquo;s his story.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s Woody Allen that crafts it as one that his audience, no matter how acquainted with his prior work, can appreciate and recognize as his own but hopefully not quite romanticize.</p>
