  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Screamers: 5/10" alt="Rating - 5/10" src="../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/5.gif"/>
  <p>Spawned from Philip K. Dick's short story &quot;Second Variety,&quot; Christian Duguay's <i>Screamers</i> (1995) materializes as a thrilling two-thirds of a film ripe with Dick's well-conceived futuristic science fiction or cyberpunk lore; conversely, it abandons the resource of potential in favor of Hollywood conventionalism in a final act of farcical explosions, contrived romance, plot twists, and a purposely inconclusive &quot;teaser&quot; ending that prompted a sequel some fourteen years later.&nbsp; While the film's continuity is often bestowed by a genuine sense of tension in a desolate futuristic landscape of shades of gray and brown, there are occasions where it is needlessly robbed by devolution into a spectacle of overwrought atmosphere and skepticism.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with apparent literary associations, the film adaptation is rather interested in extending the minor horror elements from Dick's story, thus indirectly conveying itself as a provisional version of John Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i> (1982) with an enemy believed to copy and eliminate its host subjects.<br />
 <br />
 To illuminate the intermingled state of affairs of the literature and film's illustrious backdrop, the year is 2078 in a decimated mining colony on planet Sirius 6B (replaced from &quot;Terra&quot; in the story).&nbsp; Ten years prior, a governmental force known as the New Economic Block (also altered from &quot;Russians&quot; in the written work) depleted the reserves of a highly energy efficient mineral called berynium, the world's answer to dwindling fossil fuels, and unleashed massive doses of radiation and pollution into the environment.&nbsp; The allied workers on the mining sites were subsequently deserted, bombing raids and a war ensued, and Sirius 6B was reduced to post-apocalyptia.&nbsp; To combat the NEBs, the alliance developed the autonomous mobile sword (interchanged with &quot;automatic retaliation disc&quot;) also known as the &quot;screamer&quot; or &quot;claw&quot; that burrowed under the soil to assault hostiles.&nbsp; Dan O'Bannon and Miguel Tejada-Flores' construct of the screenplay dutifully honors the universe of Philip K. Dick, but beyond the author's backdrop, their application of supplementary ideas is a relative half-cooked stew.&nbsp; With a feature-length running time, the film's most glaring fault is lack of character development in lieu of the weighty and more riveting narrative components and environmental origins.&nbsp; Moreover, a persistence of unresolved plot points and elusive clarifications stifle the immersive possibility.&nbsp; The main character of the film, Colonel Joe Hendricksson (Peter Weller), the only decently formed protagonist, is a stereotypical hard ass with a lost love, but he is a model of characterization in comparison to Michael Jefferson, a lone survivor of a downed transport headed to another planet, Triton Four.&nbsp; Jefferson, who does not appear in the short story, plays the na&iuml;ve rookie, and the film uses this personal facet as an excuse to abandon his skeleton of a story.&nbsp; Though the film never intends to become a character study in face of the increasing presence of horror and incremental death, in this circumstance, it associates human ambitions but never intends to link the chain.&nbsp; While <i>Screamers </i>is not unnecessarily overloaded with characters, it feels a bit like a mess of scenarios converging without proper resolution, as it is instead involved with suspense and philosophy.<br />
 <br />
 While the cinematically addended scenes are fairly contrived or lacking, <i>Screamers </i>and its origin story both introduce a philosophically resonant and successful concept concerning the eternal question: &quot;what does it mean to be human?&quot;&nbsp; This traditionally cyberpunk-ian theme contests the habitual definitions of humanity; while science fiction fundamentally identifies man versus machine as a central conflict with each side exhibiting the severe characteristics of the other, the ambiguity regarding the transcendence of the physical state in achieving a self-cognition is unique to the psychology of cyberpunk.&nbsp; As Dick effectively outlines the learning capabilities of the claws, the film provides a visual component to further complement ideas of mortality, sentient beings, cohabitation and/or utter divisiveness.&nbsp; To apply a most relevant quote from fellow apocalyptic sci-fi blockbuster <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i> (1991), the artificial life form, the terminator, utters, &quot;It's in your nature to destroy yourselves,&quot; to a teenage John Connor.&nbsp; This philosophical observation reflects a sense of an advanced mechanical self-awareness that Dick proposed years before that film in his original story from 1953.&nbsp; In accordance with the text of &quot;Second Variety,&quot; intricacies behind the screamer types are not completely unveiled; however, each is manufactured or created differently, which explains several unanswered questions in the film regarding the screamers' eradication of one another.&nbsp; The text expands upon this by building up to a rhetorical finale as the claws begin to implement weapons designed to target their own weaknesses.&nbsp; It's a progressively domineering struggle that highlights the irony of the future situation, perpetuating the morbid cycle of life beyond natural existence or beings that would normally be characterized as living.&nbsp; In the short story, secondary characters Klaus and Rudi openly discuss the issue amidst the looming paranoia.&nbsp; Klaus suggests, &quot;Maybe we're seeing it now, the end of human beings, the beginning of a new society,&quot; while Rudi rebuts with, &quot;They're not a race.&nbsp; They're mechanical killers.&quot;&nbsp; Klaus and Rudi are replaced by NEB soldiers Becker and Ross in the film, respectively, and both refrain from moral deliberation as each are reduced to the personification of a specific emotion. <br />
 <br />
 Although the extraneous or restructured characters in the film are underwhelming, the final section of <i>Screamers </i>acts as the proverbial nail in the coffin and the ultimate diversion from the more irresolute pessimism of the written story.&nbsp; Of course the last minute of the film is also an obvious cliffhanger, but it is a truism of horror cinema and a completely superfluous gesture to propel a franchise name.&nbsp; Dick's conclusion directly references the earlier conversations of the characters, the overarching uncertainty and inevitable downfall of the human race.&nbsp; While Tasso (renamed &quot;Jessica Hansen&quot; in the adaptation) boards the emergency rocket cruiser in Hendricksson's place, the film reverses the situation and bestows a love scenario between them.&nbsp; Jessica is revealed to be a type of screamer prior to boarding the ship, and a second screamer doppelganger then suddenly appears to battle the one known to Hendricksson.&nbsp; This entire scene draws upon the necessity for a degree of convoluted conventionality in science fiction; while the narrative can be regarded as somewhat stoically catastrophic and unfamiliar, it retains relevance in modern day to mainstream audiences by offering this relatable outlook paired with a dose of almost comical slipshod action.&nbsp; While this dilution or dumbing down is unfortunate, it introduces a moral circumstance absent within the story -- the ability of the machine to ascertain the complexity of human love and possess emotional attachment beyond the physical realm or its programmed objectives.&nbsp; Although the topic is not wholly unexplored in films of this nature, it remains marginally intriguing and averts total disaster.&nbsp; That accredited, <i>Screamers </i>most certainly squanders a greater potential and tapers off unwelcomely.&nbsp; Perhaps the film's conceptual essence can be abridged to a single idle exchange between Jefferson and Hendricksson (supposedly paralleling the one between Klaus and Rudi in the story).&nbsp; &quot;The screamers are down there breeding like rabbits, and no one knows (how)?&quot;&nbsp; Hendricksson acknowledges his concern but ardently refuses to provide an honest answer.</p>
