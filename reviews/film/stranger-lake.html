  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Stranger by the Lake: 5/10" alt="Rating - 5/10" src="../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/5.gif"/>
  <p>Alain Guiraudie&#39;s erotic thriller <strong>Stranger by the Lake</strong> [<strong>L&#39;inconnu du lac</strong>] establishes tension through repetition and a unique cyclical rhythm in a single locale.&nbsp; By initiating each of the six fades to daylight with nearly identical shots, Guiraudie at first appears to play a curious cinematographic game of &quot;spot the differences&quot; between alluringly sinister pastoral images by the unnamed retreat in the south of France.&nbsp; The approach successfully reflects a sensual duality from the milieu to the characters that is reminiscent of <span word="Götz" data-scaytid="1">Götz</span> <span word="Spielmann&#039;s" data-scaytid="2">Spielmann&#39;s</span> <a href="revanche.html"><strong>Revanche</strong></a> (2008).&nbsp; This interplay is intriguing, but it is unfortunately undercut by a series of alienating artistic decisions that revolve around an unbelievable sexual relationship between two men that is aggressively confrontational and explicit in its depiction.&nbsp; Ignoring &quot;less is more&quot; in these circumstances but also opting for a sketched rather than fleshed plot with an early focal scene involving a drowning, the film often sinks into an off-putting sequence of near-pornographic exhibitionism.&nbsp; More interesting than the trysts between men, notably Franck (Pierre <span word="Deladonchamps" data-scaytid="3">Deladonchamps</span>) and Michel (<span word="Christophe" data-scaytid="4">Christophe</span> <span word="Paou" data-scaytid="5">Paou</span>), is actually the outcast or passive interloper, middle-aged Henri (Patrick <span word="d&#039;Assumçao" data-scaytid="6">d&#39;Assumçao</span>), mythically coexisting inside and outside their love affairs.&nbsp; As he rests solitarily among the beach&#39;s rocks staring into the depths, perhaps he&#39;s attempting to find more depth of character in this provocative portrait.</p>
<p>The significance of Henri&#39;s peculiar presence, his refrain from engaging in the liaisons that consume the men along the coastline, is patiently constructed.&nbsp; Introduced as an object of the bare, youthful, and fit Franck&#39;s gaze upon swimming ashore in the crystalline waters of the lake, the camera slowly zooms in upon Henri&#39;s stocky frame, protruding from the clusters of rocks with a slightly oversized shirt, his belly hidden under fabric.&nbsp; On the nude beach, he looks a bit like a literal fish out of water (perhaps he&#39;s the <span word="silurus" data-scaytid="7">silurus</span>/large catfish of mentioned lore), as this is not his usual scene.&nbsp; However, when Franck approaches him, the two immediately hit it off, delving into intimate topics about past and profession; this conversational candor serves as the most starkly contrasted element in the film.&nbsp; As Franck becomes sexually involved with various men who frequent the area, he does not seek their histories or the expectation of companionship- only casual, fleeting fulfillment.&nbsp; But neither does anyone else.&nbsp; (Things are indeed <em>stranger</em> by the lake).&nbsp; This arrangement is exploited by the mysterious mustachioed swimmer named Michel, with the physique of a &quot;Greek god&quot; (as director Guiraudie describes), who catches Franck&#39;s eye in an impromptu display of agility and prowess in the water.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Franck, Michel appears to be taken by a rather jealous lover named <span word="Ramière" data-scaytid="8">Ramière</span> (<span word="François-Renaud" data-scaytid="9">François-Renaud</span> <span word="Labarthe" data-scaytid="10">Labarthe</span>), who rebuffs Franck&#39;s advances.&nbsp; But Michel, preoccupied with this new admirer, orchestrates a seemingly inconspicuous crime that would allow him to pursue Franck.&nbsp; Little does he know that Franck accidentally becomes a witness to it from the hillside.</p>
<p>As the days pass in <span word="Ramière&#039;s" data-scaytid="11">Ramière&#39;s</span> absence (the remaining four-fifths of the film), it becomes clear the beach-going men have chosen to dismiss the incident in pursuit of their own lusts and &quot;cruising&quot; routines (to ensnare other interested partners).&nbsp; It would appear, then, that not only is Michel or Henri a stranger by the lake but all of them to one another.&nbsp; Developing but not fully demonstrating an adroit commentary on the AIDS epidemic through the men&#39;s extreme risk-taking, Guiraudie creates a universe where this lack of concern for names and identities rather takes on a surrealist or almost science fiction sensibility.&nbsp; In an interview at the Melbourne International Film Festival, he even acknowledges it as such for viewers unfamiliar with the distinctly European environment.&nbsp; While tension is retained throughout the film as a result of the intensely hypnotic landscape cinematography, it is abandoned in the attempted evolution of Franck as a believable character, as he too abruptly shrugs off the murder and the darkest qualities of Michel&#39;s nature.&nbsp; Franck&#39;s infatuation with the bronze, chiseled Michel is most assuredly linked to the riskiness of his other behavior; and yet, on the other hand, when engaged in revealing conversations with Henri, Franck seems more conscientious and cautious than his promiscuity would indicate.&nbsp; While this discrepancy adds a sense of unpredictability to the character and film itself, it simultaneously frames his foolishness and devalues his own sensibility.&nbsp; Franck never speaks so frankly about Michel&#39;s dangerous allure; instead, it&#39;s Henri who seems more fascinated by the inevitable treachery by the lakeside.</p>
<p>Instead of steering the film in the direction of erotica, Guiraudie may have benefited from trimming the running time and increasing emphasis on Henri&#39;s role in Franck and Michel&#39;s liaisons.&nbsp; This approach, however, may have unfavorably amassed comparisons to Austrian filmmaker Michael <span word="Haneke" data-scaytid="12">Haneke</span>, whose work often studies the maliciousness of human behavior, especially in bluntly brief bouts of violence.&nbsp; The connection to Henri and the nature of violence remains curious indeed; while Guiraudie does not provide clear-cut answers, Henri&#39;s explanations about his own history and the analysis of the dynamics of the men on the beach brandish him a voyeur.&nbsp; Therefore, the initial intrigue of the film is accurately reflected within his character.&nbsp; Most of the other men seem to be fragments of a grand caricature- solely imprisoned, anchored by their own desires to the locale, while Henri&#39;s presence manages to break free and rise above the surface.&nbsp; With a film like <strong>Stranger by the Lake</strong> stripped to near-narrative outline, its success lay in character study and contemplative images, but moments of intense psychology are foregone for the explicitness of sex that is diametrically opposed to their development.&nbsp; The inclusion of such activity is necessary to the creation of a moralistic commentary, but the scenes&#39; sheer intensity and forcefulness is a point of distraction, jeopardizing the integrity of the work.&nbsp; Guiraudie attempts to lay bare the complex nature of sexual desire through nature itself but instead emerges with a film that is only remotely intriguing, leaving its viewers estranged.</p>
