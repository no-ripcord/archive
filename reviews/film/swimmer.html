  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for The Swimmer: 6/10" alt="Rating - 6/10" src="../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/6.gif"/>
  <p>Rooted in John Cheever&#39;s 1964 short story <a href="http://shortstoryclassics.50megs.com/cheeverswimmer.html">&quot;The Swimmer,&quot;</a> the collaborative effort of the same name released in 1968 by Eleanor and Frank Perry (who adapted the screenplay and directed the film, respectively) is a divisive cinematic experiment set in the opulent hills of Connecticut (instead of Cheever&#39;s original setting of Westchester County, New York) with a focus on the fit, blissfully optimistic and ostensibly well-liked Neddy Merrill (Burt Lancaster).&nbsp; At a glance, a Hollywood veteran like Lancaster is an appropriate casting choice for Cheever&#39;s descriptions of a charming but aging suburbanite; however, the star&#39;s extravagant overacting methods prove undisciplined for genuine nuance.&nbsp; Though Merrill is something of an enduring idealist, Lancaster, as if speaking upon a soap box, instills every line with too much gravity, trying to turn each scene into a magnificent spectacle, which detracts potential resonance, consistency, and hinders gradual descent into the literal and figurative darkness.&nbsp; Although unsuccessful in its attempts to overcome that erratic tone, the Perrys&#39; version of <em>The Swimmer</em> is an adequately expanded counterpart to the written word.&nbsp; While the story rushes the main character&#39;s journey through the pools of his affluent friends and acquaintances &quot;anxious not to get stuck in any conversation that would delay his voyage,&quot; the screenplay favors protracted scenes that expound a back-story more leisurely to fulfill running time requirements.&nbsp; In turn, the Perrys find value in the investment of emotional and emblematic content with Ned&#39;s evocative meetings.</p>
<p>Perhaps augmented by the 1960s&#39; revolutionary cinematic era, <em>The Swimmer</em>&#39;s weird meld of mundane melodrama and psychedelically wistful camerawork (superimposition, intense close-ups, sudden dissolves, heavy sun glare, out-of-focus shots, racing dolly shots, and naturalistic segues) are initially off-putting but suitable to Cheever&#39;s intended comingling of realism and surrealism.&nbsp; Whereas Cheever is more implicit and self-censored, the film is actively able to embrace visual fantasy and manifesting delusions of its central character.&nbsp; <em>The Swimmer</em> starts far from any kind of apparent fantasy, though, during a late summer&#39;s day where Neddy Merrill suddenly appears at the Westerhazy pool; after a surprise greeting, he impulsively decides to swim home through the valley of all his neighbors&#39; pools to celebrate the day&#39;s glory.&nbsp; As Cheever implies, Ned&#39;s journey is intended to be a sort of pilgrimage, &quot;a discovery, a contribution to modern geography,&quot; to form a metaphorical river named after his wife Lucinda.&nbsp; Before trekking to the Grahams&#39; pool, Ned traces his route across the county by &quot;taking a dogleg to the Southwest.&quot;&nbsp; In Cheever&#39;s version, there are nearly twice as many houses, likely trimmed for the film to provide each of Ned&#39;s visits with more sentimentality.&nbsp; For instance, the twenty-year-old student and former babysitter of the Merrill daughters, Julie Ann Hooper, expresses a na√Øve fascination with him in a lengthy memorable scene.&nbsp; Exchanging portions of Cheever&#39;s own words, Julie becomes intrigued and temporarily joins Ned on his personal quest; the two then reminisce about their past before reaching an emotionally charged revelation.&nbsp; Not only is the character of Julie is absent from the story, but these sorts of interactions are heavily downplayed to more bluntly showcase Merrill&#39;s disconnection amidst the other socialites.&nbsp; Cheever&#39;s &quot;Swimmer&quot; is a solitary man&#39;s journey concerned with motion and the current that carries him along, while the film adaptation stops to lament on the way to its domestic destination.</p>
<p>Modern literature may dictate the <em>The Swimmer</em>&#39;s likeness to <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, but Cheever&#39;s original intention for his story was to modernly parallel to the ancient tale of <a href="http://yeeha.org/genesis/notes/narcissus.html">Narcissus</a>, a &quot;narcissistic&quot; Greek mythological character so entranced by his own reflection in the water, he fell into a paralysis and perished.&nbsp; This premise was reportedly abandoned in the early stages of the author&#39;s conception, but it is interesting to examine how the essence of the Greek character can be viewed clearly in the cinematic allegorical adaptation.&nbsp; Student of the World&#39;s <em>Lost Books of Modern Civilization</em> blog features a formal essay entitled <a href="https://x23plane.blogspot.com/2010/10/essay-on-swimmer-by-john-cheever.html">&quot;Narcissism and Society in &#39;The Swimmer&#39;&quot;</a> that proposes color as one of the story&#39;s most significant thematic signifiers.&nbsp; Green, in particular, is referenced often, as Ned remarks he&#39;s &quot;a little green around the edges&quot; just minutes before reflecting upon his boyhood summer camp&#39;s &quot;transparent light green water.&quot;&nbsp; Obviously, green is commonly associated with the credulous and immature, traits shared by Narcissus and Neddy (a nickname likely retained from his youth).&nbsp; The color is additionally integral to the creation of environment in <em>The Swimmer</em>, one that is populated by various greenery and trees, youthfully familiar in the summer season.&nbsp; As the film laps, though, it visually and emotionally resembles a winter of discontent.&nbsp; Wearing just bathing shorts, Ned begins to shiver, appropriately juxtaposed with his more brusque and strained encounters.&nbsp; In that sense, <em>The Swimmer</em> is a tragically cyclical exercise through temporal weather not only in correlation to nature but the character&#39;s life.&nbsp; The film utilizes the portrayal of Ned Merrill through a conventionally handsome leading man, Burt Lancaster, to complement the emphasis on the obsession with beauty and outward appearances.&nbsp; Ned&#39;s glee is a fa√ßade and his delusion an escape mechanism as a result of suppressed guilt; for him, fantasy represents more than an idealism.&nbsp; Much like the character of Greek myth, fantasy becomes a fate-controlling, self-contained reality.&nbsp; David L. Quaid&#39;s cinematography unusually captures the deterioration of truth from the opening sequence where the camera carefully zooms into Ned&#39;s contemplative eyes, a man consumed in his own world; sparkling tears and hazy clouds overlie and obscure the voices amongst him.&nbsp; Ned not only lives but revels in disillusionment, as he is unaware of the damages inflicted and pain endured.&nbsp; As a representation of a stunted suburban America, the 1960s story and film urge the embrace of self-awareness and emotional responsibility instead of imaginary lifestyle. While some of the life of <em>The Swimmer</em> is drained from an overeager Lancaster, there&#39;s certain an alluring social pessimism that pulls one along in its undercurrents.</p>
