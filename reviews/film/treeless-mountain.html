  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Treeless Mountain: 6/10" alt="Rating - 6/10" src="../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/6.gif"/>
  <p>So Yong Kim's <i>Treeless Mountain</i> is an ingenuous document of the emotional complexities and transitions of childhood wrapped in the universalism of human expression.&nbsp; Even though the film is without the accompaniment of a contemporary or orchestral score, director Kim maintains a sense of urgency with her unique modus operandi, withdrawing title cards and utilizing a frequency of extreme close-ups of characters' faces, which augment the warmth provided by the handheld-like camera movements.&nbsp; As Kim is exemplary of the new school of minimalist indie filmmakers, <i>Treeless Mountain</i> is a selectively sluggish feature with a one-note narrow focus, punctuated by still life chapter divisions, which manage to permeate the film's target audience but regrettably emphasize narrative and emotional absences as routinely as the intimacies.&nbsp; Most notably, however, is the camera's consistent undertaking of the parental role in the face of the two young female protagonists' variable and figuratively apparitional mother figure.<br />
<br />
In one of the most significant scenes in the film, seven-year-old Jin leaves the supervision of her aunt in the small town of Heunghae to the care of her grandmother in the rural Korean countryside.&nbsp; Her younger sister of five, Bin, sits across the aisle of the bus and inquires about the reappearance of their mother to which Jin brokenly replies, &quot;Mom's not coming, stupid.&quot;&nbsp; At this precise moment, <i>Treeless Mountain</i> officially reaches its intention as a premature coming-of-age story.&nbsp; The hasty opening scenes in the film depict the modern normalcy of a single mother with her oldest daughter in a Seoul elementary school and youngest in a daycare, but the uncommunicativeness between them and repressed financial and maternal hardship insinuate the inevitability of tumult.&nbsp; Of course, due to the subdued realism of Kim's directing, the descent is more of a gradual drifting away from integrated urban culture.&nbsp; Jin and Bin are led astray from their high-rise apartment in Seoul City to a village home in Heunghae, and finally to a farmhouse.&nbsp; A feeling of helplessness permeates each of these transitional periods, a product of adults' mismanagement and irresponsibility (most significantly Big Aunt's alcoholic exploitations and impulsive disappearances).&nbsp; At Jin and Bin's vulnerable ages, it is their precise route to an ultimate mistrust of adults, and the film bluntly stresses this apprehension through omission of official names.<br />
<br />
Jin and Bin's nicknames for various middle-aged adults like &quot;lady,&quot; &quot;mister,&quot; and the familial &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;Big Aunt&quot; are veracious in that they capture a child's experiences of relating to the external world based on prefixes and outward appearances.&nbsp; However, the refusal to incorporate formal names into the story also unveils an ulterior layer to the children's designations; the majority of middle-aged adults that Jin and Bin cross, with the exception of Hyun's mother, are foreign and neglectful toward them.&nbsp; It is only within the film's final act that a humane investment is reciprocated by the merciful grandmother, who restores their faith and good nature.&nbsp; While Jin and Bin have endured repeated abandonment, they seem revived and motivated while working as modest farmhands.&nbsp; As Jin walks along the hillside to fetch a pale of water, she segues into song as Bin playfully harmonizes.&nbsp; &quot;I want to walk up the side of a mountain.&nbsp; I want to walk down the other side of the mountain.&nbsp; I want to swim in a river, lie in the sun; I want to try to be nice... to everyone.&quot;&nbsp; Through this reassured goodwill, the girls are defined as mature and evolved characters far beyond their years.&nbsp; Once duped into performing menial tasks for their aunt and roasting grasshoppers to fill their piggy bank with coins to re-summon their mother, Jin and Bin learn to relish their cognizant independence.<br />
<br />
As the film changes locale at three separate points, attempts to unify them materialize in static transitional frames, whether a low-angle of the cloudy sky, the longshot of the glowing horizon or a closeup still life of domestic objects.&nbsp; The variance of distance between them is a bit disassociating, a breach from the collective nature of events, even if they share similar physical properties and tone.&nbsp; Specific images like a dress draped over a clothing line on a damp evening or the inertia of a sunset amidst village homes are humane and naturalistic, complementary to the protagonists, but they are also a blunt and superfluous marker for lifelessness in a film which intends to showcase an imperative restlessness or gravity.&nbsp; <i>Treeless Mountain</i> succeeds when it instead seamlessly assimilates the beauty of its environment into narrative for a rich and cohesive representation, like the early scenes in the bustling Heunghae market, which then beckon the viewer toward repeated viewings to uncover background detail.<br />
<br />
The film's title is an evocation of an arduous journey or an upwards climb without the rewards of a traditional spiritual quest.&nbsp; A third of the way through <i>Treeless Mountain</i>, Bin attempts to plant a tree atop a pile of rubble that overlooks the Huenghae bus stop where she expects her mother to return, but there's a deficiency of nutrients for its growth in the same sense that there's a lack of hope that the mother will return.&nbsp; The barren, infertile environment and transient habitats for the girls are a commentary on the nature of the ever-changing modern family, which disallows a natural youthful development.&nbsp; As the film concludes on a propitious note, the grandmother's life is consciously limited, and Jin and Bin may soon re-enter another similar problematic custodial cycle.</p>
