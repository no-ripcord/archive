  <p><strong>The Waiting Room</strong> is a new <span word="cinéma" data-scaytid="3">cinéma</span> <span word="vérité" data-scaytid="4">vérité</span> documentary outside of traditional news coverage and human interest stories that occurs over the course of a twenty-four hour period at&nbsp;Highland&nbsp;Hospital&nbsp;in&nbsp;Oakland,&nbsp;California. &nbsp;(The tense tagline reads &quot;24 hours. 241 patients. One stretched ER&quot;). &nbsp;Plagued with an unruly number of patients waiting for emergency and primary care services, the hospital is forced to treat people like they&#39;re customers in a delicatessen by employing a &#39;take a number&#39; system. &nbsp;The documentary features no talking heads, no titles, no narration, no statistical <span word="intertitles" data-scaytid="7">intertitles</span>, minimal music and political diversion; this compelling first-person approach allows viewers to step into the disorienting daily life of the hospital while curbing emotional and political manipulations. &nbsp;<strong>The Waiting Room</strong>&nbsp;is intensely focused on its human subjects, naturally relaying their circumstances without juxtaposing them with extrapolated numbers and authoritative advice. &nbsp;The filmmakers&#39; <span word="dialogue" data-scaytid="8">dialogue</span> begins and ends in the editing room, simply segmenting the film through various stages of the treatment process. &nbsp;Director Peter Nicks decided to tackle this project not just as a film but an entire &quot;<a href="http://www.whatruwaitingfor.com/storytelling-project/">storytelling project</a>,&quot; as described on the official website, which allows other patients to share their stories on the site via <a href="https://vimeo.com/documentfilms"><span word="Vimeo" data-scaytid="9">Vimeo</span></a>.&nbsp; Nicks&#39; wife, who also works for&nbsp;Highland&nbsp;Hospital, provided motivation and his access to the facility. &nbsp;In an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec12/documentary_07-18.html">interview</a> with PBS this past July, he also reveals a need for the film in a time where &quot;policies being made are going to affect individuals and communities for possibly generations...&quot; and that &quot;people&#39;s voices, particularly in public hospitals like this one... were not being heard and represented in that conversation.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />As it is well-known, the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;is the only industrialized country that does not have universal healthcare. &nbsp;President Obama once campaigned on the promise of providing it and eventually drafted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (informally known to many critics as &quot;Obamacare&quot;) to limit the number of uninsured Americans and reduce costs. &nbsp;This political implication is not introduced in&nbsp;<strong>The Waiting Room</strong>, but it certainly looms over it as a prerequisite for properly understanding its urgency. &nbsp;Utilizing the most literal and apt title, the almost exclusive focus inside the hospital transforms the waiting room beyond its function into a character itself, a sanctuary and a temporary residence for those anticipating the next available doctor. &nbsp;The film opens with a number of profiles in the preliminary examination process with certified nursing assistant Cynthia Johnson. &nbsp;Among those who seek care are a young girl with a possible tonsil infection, a partly employed mid-twenties man with a testicular tumor, and a middle-aged carpenter who has developed painful bone spurs. &nbsp;With her distinctive, sassy sense of humor and desire for civility, Ms. Johnson eases patients by engaging them in droll conversation. &nbsp;After the patients are vetted, they are carefully examined by one of the resilient on-site doctors. &nbsp;Douglas White, the most prominent among them, calmly talks about the act of juggling patients and frequent moral dilemmas. &nbsp;With&nbsp;Highland&#39;s chronic shortage of beds and the fact that some admitted do not have homes or necessary resources, Dr. White chooses to retain them until he can identify a city refuge for them. &nbsp;He expresses concern about releasing someone into the streets when it&#39;s clear that it will exacerbate their condition. &nbsp;This is further complicated by the film&#39;s potent dichotomy &ndash; the fact that several of those anticipating treatment are not in the ER for traumatic emergencies but rather primary care that a standard physician would normally administer. &nbsp;The immense anxiety builds as uninsured people flood into the ER for basic health care assistance. &nbsp;These patients are additionally competing with those in life-or-death situations, as the trauma unit is forced to divert attention from other patients and tasks at hand, repeatedly delaying some men and women in need of aid.&nbsp; In one instance, a nurse even shockingly reports that a man has been waiting seven hours for a prescription of&nbsp;acetaminophen.<br />&nbsp;<br />While&nbsp;<strong>The Waiting Room</strong>&nbsp;portrays the inner world of a hospital, its aspirations and issues obviously reach beyond the walls. &nbsp;In a late scene, a fifteen-year-old boy arrives in the ER with a gunshot wound, and the trauma team attempts to revive him in vain. &nbsp;Perhaps this is one case of many that troubles the team each and every week; the documentary does not link statistics or occurrences, but the presence of the fatally wounded boy elicits a sense of urban violence afflicting the current healthcare system. &nbsp;The indirect way in which the topic is introduced immediately places it in the context of others waiting for care rather than the necessity of broader reform; there are not recurring bullet points on an agenda. &nbsp;There is tremendous strain beyond the control of anyone involved at the hospital, but the fact remains that the doctors are devoted to saving lives regardless of the scenario. &nbsp;It speaks to the dedication of those in the medical profession and the desire to restore human life at any cost. &nbsp;Once a regional project, the theatrical release for&nbsp;<strong>The Waiting Room</strong>&nbsp;was generously funded by a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openhood/the-waiting-room-theatrical-release"><span word="Kickstarter" data-scaytid="10">Kickstarter</span> campaign</a> recently.&nbsp; Peter Nicks and crew successfully raised $75,000 in late July. &nbsp;Since then, the film screened in&nbsp;Madison,&nbsp;WI, on the last day of August as part of the seasonal <a href="http://cinema.wisc.edu/series/2012/fall/premiere-showcase">premiere showcase</a> in Cinematheque programming. &nbsp;In late September, it will be shown in&nbsp;New York City, and&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;dates will be announced thereafter. &nbsp;What began as a personal consensus of&nbsp;America&#39;s healthcare has grown into a large and pivotal project in American documentary filmmaking. &nbsp;Nicks has continued to develop it into a multimedia project by requesting the public&#39;s active <a href="http://www.whatruwaitingfor.com/film/contact/">participation online</a>.&nbsp; At just 81 minutes,&nbsp;<strong>The Waiting Room</strong>&nbsp;captures an urgency to reform the system without one spoken word from the director over the course of the film. &nbsp;However, Nicks&#39; message is explicit, and the real stories he captures are not easily shaken from memory. &nbsp;He has allowed ordinary Americans to be seen and heard, and hopefully they will not be eternally waiting for a reformation.</p>
