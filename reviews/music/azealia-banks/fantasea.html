  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Fantasea - Azealia Banks : 7/10" alt="Rating - 7/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/7.gif"/>
  <p>Whether you loved hit single <em>212 </em>or hated it, whether you thought <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="3">Azealia</span> Banks would never make something better or had faith in her, and whatever the year&rsquo;s earlier <strong>1991 EP </strong>did to confirm or dissuade those opinions, her most recent offering, the <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="5">mixtape</span> <strong><span word="Fantasea" data-scaytid="7">Fantasea</span></strong>, is sure to make you see Banks and her vulgar rapid-fire rapping in a new light.</p>
<p>Before releasing the <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="8">mixtape</span>, Banks said that &ldquo;This is a test run... I tried a lot of cool things... Sounds I thought were progressive, beats made by close friends, different flows.&rdquo; What that also suggests is that there are probably a lot of producers, and with 15 in 19 tracks, it&rsquo;s something that she probably did not need to include. What she also said is that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;first album of sorts,&rdquo; but with so many different producers, the <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="9">mixtape</span> is so eclectic, going from ballads to dance-club beats to instrumental doodles and everything else, that to categorize it as such is probably to misunderstand what an album typically aims to be in terms of cohesiveness and style. <em><span word="L8R" data-scaytid="12">L8R</span> </em>becomes a completely different song at the end, <span word="andthe" data-scaytid="14">andthe</span> title track turns into a completely different bass line that disappears before coming back thirteen tracks later on <em><span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="13">Azealia</span> Skit</em>. Even then, its presence is just a background for Banks to send out a thank you to friends, family, producers, and listeners. The production of <strong><span word="Fantasea" data-scaytid="16">Fantasea</span> </strong>is all over the place.</p>
<p>What that means, though, is that <strong><span word="Fantasea" data-scaytid="18">Fantasea</span> </strong>is a perfect place for Banks to show off her versatility, rapping to <span word="Machinedrum’s" data-scaytid="20">Machinedrum&rsquo;s</span> relentless beats with her trademark, &ldquo;what&rsquo;d she say&rdquo; style before, on <em>Luxury</em>, slowing things down to show she can sing as well as she can rap. It&rsquo;s these moments, where Banks lets a bit more emotion into her voice that the <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="21">mixtape</span> is at its best. There is no better example than on the release&rsquo;s greatest track, <em>Us</em>, where a beat not as club-ready as many others here is, as expected, penetrated with Banks one-up lyrics, but delivered almost in a <span word="confessionary" data-scaytid="23">confessionary</span> way that we would never expect. &ldquo;Cause I can&#39;t entertain you/I got nothing to say to <span word="ya" data-scaytid="24">ya</span>/I don&#39;t even blame you/If I was you I&#39;d hate too&rdquo; is her slowest and both her most vulnerable and celebratory delivery, but it&rsquo;s the way she alternates her slow taunts with her motor-mouthed &ldquo;talk first, think later&rdquo; that really make the song, perhaps her best yet, or at least the best display of her talent. The other contender is the more dance-friendly but exotic work on <em><span word="Esta" data-scaytid="25">Esta</span> <span word="Noche" data-scaytid="26">Noche</span></em>, where the versatile DJ <span word="Munchi" data-scaytid="27">Munchi</span> seems to be throwing hoops to test Banks, and she delivers by linking one bar to the next in impressive ways. Her command of tone and her own flow is on full display, and it is the best example of Banks wide-ranging style. Both suffer from an inability to escape their artists own lyrical trappings, but they epitomize everything she aimed to do with this release.</p>
<p>Of course, <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="28">Azealia</span> Banks would not be <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="29">Azealia</span> Banks if she couldn&rsquo;t spit acid and congratulate herself, and she does that very well on the opener <em>Out of Space</em>, which is aided by Liam <span word="Howlett" data-scaytid="32">Howlett</span> (of The Prodigy) and his characteristically unorthodox, syncopated production. Some of the more commercial attempts, such as <em>Fuck Up The Fun</em> and <em>Nathan</em> are less effective, coming off as less catchy <em>212 </em>imitators, and the rhyme-game experiment of <em><span word="Jumanji" data-scaytid="33">Jumanji</span></em> is clearly <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="34">mixtape</span> material that would never get near an album. Still, the first few songs are a reminder that <span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="35">Azealia</span> Banks won&rsquo;t stop delivering dance-heavy, vulgar anti-anthems.</p>
<p>As one would expect from a <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="38">mixtape</span>, there are several tracks here that Banks likely threw in for fun or as an experiment. In addition to the aforementioned <em><span word="Jumanji" data-scaytid="40">Jumanji</span></em> and <em><span word="Azealia" data-scaytid="41">Azealia</span> Skit</em>, <em><span word="Ima" data-scaytid="44">Ima</span> Read </em>plays like an unfinished, sarcastic address to her critics. <em>Salute </em>is a closer that lacks the punctuation that one would expect on a more proper album, and after <em><span word="Esta" data-scaytid="45">Esta</span> <span word="Noche" data-scaytid="46">Noche</span></em> shows Banks merging ultra-harsh production with her stilted delivery, it feels unnecessary. Still, even these tracks show an unexpected amount of depth from Banks, as they demonstrate her ability to curb her delivery around many different producers&rsquo; styles in her own way.</p>
<p><strong><span word="Fantasea" data-scaytid="49">Fantasea</span> </strong>certainly suffers from a lack of direction or consistency, but it also is a perfect way to silence her critics. Many of these songs are the best <span word="fusions" data-scaytid="51">fusions</span> of dance and rap you will hear all year, and the weaker tracks still display skills or strengths&mdash;and a few weaknesses&mdash;that we didn&rsquo;t know Banks had. 19 tracks and 53 minutes of her hateful, limited vocabulary is a bit much, but when Banks is on, she sounds like she will never go off. Regardless of what you think of <em>212 </em>or <strong>1991 EP</strong>, <strong><span word="Fantasea" data-scaytid="52">Fantasea</span> </strong>is so coated in eclecticism that you will think far more of her as a musician and MC for listening to it, even if you hate her materialist, vulgar, and, too-often, poor lyrics. Still, with such great beats and such impeccable flow in her stylish deliveries, her <span word="ineloquence" data-scaytid="54">ineloquence</span> can be forgiven.</p>
