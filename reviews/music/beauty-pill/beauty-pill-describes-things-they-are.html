  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are - Beauty Pill : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>In 2011, the Washington D.C. avant rock group Beauty Pill took residence at the Black Box <span word="Theatre" data-scaytid="1">Theatre</span> in the city&rsquo;s multimedia art center, <span word="Artisphere" data-scaytid="2">Artisphere</span>, to record an album as part of a live exhibition called <em>Immersive Ideal</em>.&nbsp; The band&rsquo;s processes and creative interaction opened to foot traffic, guests and curious passersby, and they used the space to record music for its first album since its 2004 debut LP, <strong>The Unsustainable Lifestyle</strong>.&nbsp; This album is <strong>Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are</strong>, an <span word="electrifyingly" data-scaytid="4">electrifyingly</span> poignant and personally reflective collection of songs that almost weren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; In 2007, Chad Clark, lead creative presence behind Beauty Pill, had undergone open-heart surgery after contracting viral <span word="cardiomyopathy" data-scaytid="5">cardiomyopathy</span>.&nbsp; His chances for survival weren&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>As testimonial to a &quot;second chance&rdquo; or a &ldquo;new lease on life,&rdquo; Clark&rsquo;s story does activate a host of <span word="clichés" data-scaytid="6">clichés</span> regarding the preciousness of life, the gratitude one feels at having eluded death and enlivening the need to truly seize every waking moment one has.&nbsp; In the album&rsquo;s opening track, <em><span word="Drapetomania" data-scaytid="9">Drapetomania</span></em>, Clark&rsquo;s first line is <em>&ldquo;I want more life, fucker,&rdquo;</em> a line pulled from <strong>Blade Runner</strong> that probably means as much contextually here as it does in the film.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s alive thanks to technology, but not at the expense of his humanity, which, in Clark&rsquo;s mind, doesn&rsquo;t just pertain to his own experiences.&nbsp; <strong>Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are</strong> thrives because it&rsquo;s more than just documentation of the biographical <em>Near Miss Stories</em> that Clark could very well have, and understandably so, relied upon for the bulk of this record.&nbsp; Instead, he treats himself as a mere touchstone and allows the creative direction of his music to illustrate the impact this illness has had on his life and outlook.</p>
<p>Throughout most of <strong>Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are</strong>, there&rsquo;s a wealth of circuitry that designs the overall package, a surgical assembly of found sounds and electronics, conventional instrumentation and synthetic textures.&nbsp; Though this very clinical assessment cancels out the humanity behind Beauty Pill&rsquo;s album, the influence of the electronic medium correlates directly with Clark&rsquo;s recovery.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2015/04/26/401470798/it-crackles-with-life-beauty-pill-returns">In a recent interview with NPR</a>, Clark explained that he was unable to hold a guitar following his surgery and therefore relied on his laptop to help him write and compose music, opening him up to the creative opportunities made available by technology.&nbsp; This direction had evidently carried over into the Immersive Ideal sessions resulting in a very rich consonance of instruments and varied electronic tones.&nbsp; You hear it immediately in the aforementioned <em><span word="Drapetomania" data-scaytid="10">Drapetomania</span></em>, a jovial melody and a dose of aural sugar.&nbsp; The uplift from the album&rsquo;s intro continues with <em>Afrikaner Barista</em>, one of its earliest singles.&nbsp; With an electrified sway comparable to <strong>Dear Science</strong>-era TV On The Radio and a glowing ensemble of brass, Beauty Pill&rsquo;s construct absolutely flourishes with a pair of headphones, every musical element discernable.</p>
<p>The strongest concentration of songs begins with <em>Ann The Word</em>, a song that had originally surfaced online in 2006 and marked a change in creative direction for Clark.&nbsp; <em>Ann The Word</em> details the final moments of a couple trapped in a car as it sinks into the ocean, a <span word="shamisen" data-scaytid="16">shamisen</span> providing its key melody as multiple tones envelope the music like the water swallowing the car.&nbsp; Singer Jean Cook delivers the words with a chilling acceptance: <em>&ldquo;You and me&hellip; We&rsquo;re fucked. We&rsquo;re free. If we call it fate, it&rsquo;s already too late.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; The final moments of two drowning lovers transitions into the pensive and heavily percussive <em>Steven &amp; <span word="Tiwonge" data-scaytid="14">Tiwonge</span></em>, which is based on a gay Malawi couple that were sentenced to 14 years in prison for violating the country&rsquo;s anti-gay laws.&nbsp; Clark expresses nuance beautifully, juxtaposing each character with slight lyrical changes in each stanza, the same story being told from a different point of view.&nbsp; And then <em>Ain&rsquo;t A Jury In The World <span word="Gon’" data-scaytid="17">Gon&rsquo;</span> Convict You, Baby</em> wears a pulsing bass throb and distant string melody as it slowly bounces, a selection of percussion instruments ringing and clanging.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so much for the ears to find.</p>
<p>As <strong>Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are</strong> reaches its second half, following the tom-laden crawl of <em>Exit Without Saving</em>, Clark taps <span word="Arto" data-scaytid="19">Arto</span> Lindsay for <em>The Prize</em>, electric samba accented by lush strings, wild clarinet and acoustic elements.&nbsp; Acoustic instrumentation is carried with <em>Dog With Rabbit In Mouth, Unharmed</em>, the album&rsquo;s most folk-centric offering and recent single.&nbsp; Harp strings are plucked and psychedelic wafts of sound grace the key melody as Cook sings, <em>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to look too close to see what time is doing to me.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; Mortality readdressed.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Caribbean feel to <em>For Pretend</em>, which explains method acting to children of various ages (<em>&ldquo;That woman&rsquo;s an actor, sweetheart/She is only screaming for pretend/She will be okay in the end/Tears are years of practice and the blood is a synthetic blend/Just syrups dyed red/I know it&rsquo;s confusing when you&rsquo;re ten.&rdquo;</em>)&nbsp; Clark&rsquo;s voice has the patient and sympathetic tone of a parent throughout, even when he becomes the actor and explains that he&rsquo;s not really a recovering drug addict. (<em>&ldquo;I think that you get it, you&rsquo;re fifteen.&rdquo;</em>)&nbsp; Ultimately, the actor&rsquo;s methodology takes him over and he winds up with nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When Cornered</em> is a quick and relatively violent shot of heightened tempo before <em>Near Miss Stories</em>, Clark&rsquo;s only direct acknowledgment of his surgery: <em>&ldquo;Stethoscope on my chest, he says we&rsquo;d better do this fast/One of these beats of your heart is gonna be the last.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; Once again seeking resonance through nuance, he owns his good fortune by repeating <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so lucky.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; He then turns that sentiment to you by saying <em>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re so lucky&rdquo;</em> to be alive.&nbsp;<span>The final track is a cover of </span><em>Ann The Word</em><span> by Lungfish, which has no connection to the aforementioned Beauty Pill song of the same title.&nbsp; The song originally appeared in Lungfish&rsquo;s 1998 album, </span><strong>Artificial Horizon</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hearing <strong>Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are</strong>, Clark&rsquo;s story so integral to the finished product, I was reminded of Robert Wyatt, whose physical paralysis following an accidental fall forced him to rethink the music that would comprise his 1974 masterpiece, <strong>Rock Bottom</strong>.&nbsp; For Clark, who had already produced two EPs and an excellent full-length record, this willingness to think and compose differently due to a change in circumstance shows a need to move forward and create.&nbsp; The obstacles, as profound as they remain, have, once again, inspired a masterpiece.&nbsp; In the song <em>The Idiot Heart</em>, featured in Beauty Pill&rsquo;s 2001 EP <strong>The Cigarette Girl From The Future</strong>, (also recently reissued by Butterscotch Records), there&rsquo;s a line that says, <em>&ldquo;&hellip;The bad news is there is no hope/The good news is there never was/So it&#39;s not a question of surrender.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; For Clark, surrender didn&rsquo;t even seem like an option and hope, well, evidently there was some to be had after all.</p>
