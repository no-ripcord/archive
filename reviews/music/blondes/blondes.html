  <p align="LEFT">They say that flattery will get you everywhere, so before we start I&#39;d just like to say: Congratulations! The fact that you&#39;re here reading this review of a (relatively) obscure electronic album on a (sadly) not exactly massive music website suggests that you&#39;re an informed consumer and really know your stuff.</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, odds are as an informed consumer that there are people you know - maybe friends, probably family - whose musical preferences drive you slightly mad. Not necessarily what they listen to, but rather how they listen to it; most likely, they&#39;re still using the earphones that came with their iPods despite your repeated protestations.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But help is at hand in the arrival of the self-titled debut by Brooklyn-based Blondes as rarely has an album <span word="benefitted" data-scaytid="2">benefitted</span> quite so much from an upgrade in audio equipment. Listen to it through something bog-standard like in-built computer speakers and it seems like an hour of very pleasant, dreamy, retro <span word="synth-wash" data-scaytid="3">synth-wash</span>, but when run through a half-decent pair of earphones (and we&#39;re not talking serious audiophile kit here - mine only cost around <span word="£30" data-scaytid="4">&pound;30</span>) it&#39;s astounding. The sheer amount of detail, all fascinating and absorbing in its own right and perfectly pitched and placed, that reveals itself is rather like going from black and white to <span word="technicolour" data-scaytid="5">technicolour</span> and the difference will be more than enough to convince anyone of the importance of a decent technical set-up. For example, closer inspection of opener <em>Lover</em> unveils echoing, rhythmic chanting (sampled from a work by minimalist composer, multidisciplinary artist and <em>off-beat</em> vocalist Meredith Monk) that <span word="unsettlingly" data-scaytid="6">unsettlingly</span>, but wonderfully, buries itself right in the subconscious and icy <span word="synth" data-scaytid="7">synth</span> stabs that are effective enough to send a shiver down the spine, and its every beat comes across like a sucker-punch right in the gut. Truthfully the album never gets quite that exciting again, but, oh my, how exciting it is while it lasts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If I were to start going on about how <strong>Blondes</strong> provides a perfect example of the transformative power of pure sound, you&#39;d (rightly) put me down as a bit of a knob, but unfortunately that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got, especially considering just how unappealing the alternative terms that have been thrown around in relation to the album are; the <span word="favoured" data-scaytid="8">favoured</span> one being Hipster House, presumably because what the duo are up to ostensibly sounds a bit like House music, but is slightly useless if you approach it as such (any attempt to dance to this record will most likely result in a slightly lopsided, somnambulant shuffle). Besides, the only real House number is the appropriately titled <em>Pleasure</em>, and even that doesn&#39;t allow itself to stay quite so straightforward for long, introducing at its midpoint an effect that sounds like a tape reversing over and over, and beautifully so - it&#39;s almost enough to get lost in for hours in itself. Otherwise, the duo are very much following in the steps of acts like Fuck Buttons in <span word="repurposing" data-scaytid="9">repurposing</span> <span word="90s" data-scaytid="10">90s</span> dance music into something dreamier, or to extend things a little further, slotting themselves in nicely alongside Animal Collective&#39;s <span word="hypnagogic" data-scaytid="11">hypnagogic</span> pop (now there&#39;s a term that&#39;s spectacularly ugly, but sadly also too accurate to eschew).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately for this review, the music itself doesn&#39;t really offer me anything particularly deep to talk about; the titles might come in pairs, suggesting a sense of duality and mirror imaging - <em>Lover</em>/<em>Hater</em>, <em>Business</em>/<em>Pleasure</em>, <em>Wine</em>/<em>Water</em> and <em>Gold</em>/<em>Amber</em> (and also highlighting that three quarters of the album has already been released on 12&quot;) - but the tracks themselves don&#39;t really seem to support such analysis, instead it&#39;s all about the feeling, which is unfailingly euphoric no matter what the song&#39;s called. And I can&#39;t even prove my <span word="muso" data-scaytid="12">muso</span> credentials by comparing them to an even more obscure artist that even you might not have heard of (although to be honest that&#39;s probably unlikely as there&#39;s a good chance that you know more about this stuff than I do) as slap-bang in the middle of the album&#39;s press release is the claim that their main influence is composer and inspirational <span word="Kosmiche" data-scaytid="13">Kosmiche</span> figure Manuel <span word="Göttsching" data-scaytid="14">Göttsching</span> and, yes, their album does sound very much like his work, just spruced up and expanded to reflect and take advantage of the ongoing march of technical progress. Instead all I have is waffling on about <strong>Blondes</strong>&#39; musical highlights, both massive and minuscule - such as the constantly bubbling-under electro of <em>Gold</em>, the clattering drums of <em>Hater</em>, the industrial-sized panpipes of <em>Wine</em>, and, conversely, <em>Amber</em>&#39;s sparseness, which sees out the album with just a distant <span word="bassline" data-scaytid="15">bassline</span> like the sound of a heartbeat, almost as if it&#39;s a retreat to the womb. Considering just how gorgeously detailed their work is from top to bottom, it&#39;s a bit difficult to believe their label&#39;s claim that it&#39;s mostly improvised.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, there&#39;s only a short jump from being an informed consumer to being a cynical one; really all it takes is having to listen to one too many derivative, or just slightly too knowing records, and yes, if you&#39;re looking to pick faults in Blondes&#39; debut there are plenty to be found. Not just that if you don&#39;t give it your full attention then it becomes a bit of a blur, but that it&#39;s a long album (and an even longer one if you count the second <span word="disc" data-scaytid="16">disc</span> of remixes) that splurges most of its best ideas in the first track; that the intriguing ideas suggested by the track names don&#39;t really add up to anything when you hear them; that it&#39;s nothing particularly new - both in the sense that the majority of the album has already been released as singles and that there are other artists who have walked this path before them; or, <span word="y&#039;know" data-scaytid="17">y&#39;know</span> that the idea of House music that you can in no way dance to seems spectacularly pointless (personally, I found it worked best as fuel for treadmill-based reveries). You could do all that, but you&#39;d be better off just going with it, admitting that you&#39;re probably not going to find another record quite so beautifully produced this year, or quite so warmly inviting, or just quite so full of lovely stuff.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So, in other words: great album, shame about the review. I do feel bad for letting you - you wonderful, brilliant, informed consumer - down, but considering my opinion can, and possibly should, be boiled down to the words &quot;Buy this record!!!&quot; (preferably written over and over, <strong>The Shining</strong> style, albeit in a luridly <span word="coloured" data-scaytid="18">coloured</span>, <span word="72pt" data-scaytid="19">72pt</span> sized font) I&#39;m also surprised I managed to get this much material out of it.&nbsp;</p>
