  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Teens of Denial - Car Seat Headrest : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>Will Toledo likes to make fun of his own contempt. The humor is dry and sober, disguised with a self-trumpeting seriousness that also exposes his impotence. Some of it is darned brilliant. <em>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to hear that shake in my voice/ my pain is my own,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Toledo quivers in one of <strong>Teens of Denial&rsquo;s</strong> most <span word="anthemic" data-scaytid="1">anthemic</span> moments, giving way to a disillusionment that stifles his own conviction. And so it goes for the majority of Toledo&rsquo;s first &ldquo;actual&rdquo; full-length as Car Seat Headrest, a project he&#39;s long-gestated by way of his own <span word="bandcamp" data-scaytid="2">bandcamp</span> account before Matador signed him late last year. It&rsquo;s a pretty sweet deal for the profusely bummed-out Toledo, though instead of making peace with his own conscience, it&rsquo;s good to know that <strong>Denial</strong> still preserves a time and a place that honors his younger self.</p>
<p>Toledo&rsquo;s shameful witticisms are encrusted within the quaint bricks and walls of colonial Williamsburg, the city that played as a setting for most of his songwriting during his college years. Most of <strong>Denial</strong> was written during this time, so there&rsquo;s a <span word="chucklesome" data-scaytid="5">chucklesome</span> angst that appropriately expresses the confusion of being at an age where you&rsquo;re transitioning from college to adulthood. There&rsquo;s an infinite amount of quotable lines throughout that alternate between fiction and reality, and they often express a strong wish that things could be different; <span word="desiderative" data-scaytid="6">desiderative</span> phrases like &ldquo;if only&rdquo; are spread through thick and thin, making for a compelling narrator who&rsquo;s both sides empathetic and pitiful. He has a remarkable range of emotional truths: <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to articulate it/ that empty feeling/ you share the same fate as the people you hate,&quot;</em> Toledo points out with an almost matter-of-fact tone over a <span word="Byrds-ian" data-scaytid="7">Byrds-ian</span> chord progression in <em>Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales</em>, a six-minute <span word="multiparter" data-scaytid="8">multiparter</span> that begins with a quietly sustained chord (which is fast-becoming his signature style) until in breaks into a mirthful sing-a-long.</p>
<p>As it is with younger musicians who&rsquo;ve been exposed to music during the emergence of the information age, there&rsquo;s a deluge of influences speckled throughout <strong>Teens of Denial&rsquo;s</strong> hour-long runtime. Even if he borrows from many sources, he&rsquo;s made the resolute choice of emphasizing some fuzz-powered chaos on a grand scale. He&rsquo;s very consistent with his choices: the sugar power rush of <em>Unforgiving Girl (She&rsquo;s Not An)</em> manages to fit in some Badfinger guitar hooks with the Strokes&rsquo; spiked-up backbeat, while the cowbell-measured <em>Destroyed by Hippie Powers </em>gathers its strength from the forceful riffs and sardonic reflections of mid-nineties bands like Fountains of Wayne and Harvey Danger. But this revisionist homage is heightened to unprecedented levels with the thoughtfully conceived <em>Just What I Needed/Not What I Needed</em>, which seamlessly cobbles together a chord progression reminiscent to The Cars&rsquo; iconic <em>Just What I Needed</em> until it actually morphs INTO <em>Just What I Needed</em>. Unfortunately, the track has since been scrapped due to a licensing conflict, and to meet Ric Ocasek&rsquo;s wish of not sampling the track; thankfully, it&rsquo;s been reworked in similar fashion, and in fact retains and improves upon the originals&rsquo; potent chorus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an ease that surrounds his overall comportment, which is a feat considering Toledo has a never-ending itch to write complicated song structures. And yet he never succumbs to heavy-handed improvisations: the eleven and a half minute <em>The Ballad of Costa Concordia</em> is for the most part an airy, country-ballad replete with grandstanding horns that otherwise offer up some disconcerting insight into his unease (<em>&ldquo;If only I could sustain my anger/ feel it stronger and stronger/ it sharpens to a point it sheds my skin&rdquo;</em>), gradually building up into a cathartic anthem that would make David Berman proud. And then it just completely veers off the rails with a galloping finish where Toledo puts an end to his anxiety with hardly any resolve as he refrains, <em>&quot;I give up!&quot;</em> The minor jest to U2 with its faint use of delay is also cheekily amusing; and I said before, the guy&rsquo;s got a shrewd sense of humor. But Toledo doesn&rsquo;t always rely on the self-referential as a crutch, and in the parenthetical-friendly <em>(Joe Gets Kicked Out of School for Using) Drugs With Friends (But Says This Isn&rsquo;t a Problem)</em>, which is one of the only tracks I&rsquo;d attribute some lazy comparison to Pavement, he transforms into everyday alter ego Joe. He chronicles one of the most compelling acid trips put on record, using a hilarious reference to the film Saló with startling effect and in a way that doesn&rsquo;t come across as highbrow.</p>
<p>Despite his unrestrained self-deprecation, Toledo adopts an amiable trait of character that makes him affecting in his misery. If anything, he&rsquo;ll find any reason to mock his own pretensions. <em>&ldquo;You have no right to be depressed / You haven&rsquo;t tried hard enough to like it,&rdquo;</em> he wisecracks, later stating the point that he hasn&rsquo;t lived long enough to experience life&rsquo;s true challenges. There&rsquo;s a lot that Toledo is worried about throughout <strong>Teens of Denial</strong>: joblessness, a spiritual emptiness, losing his keys, a lack of good porn. It&rsquo;s the adequate album to write when you&rsquo;re on a quest to become something, later to realize that you&rsquo;ve no idea how to carry on fulfilling that need. It&rsquo;s a transition that Toledo perfectly captures, one that he&rsquo;s relieved to have outgrown. One that he&rsquo;ll soon realize he&rsquo;s going to have to revisit over and over again. At least he got a killer rock album out of it. &nbsp;</p>
