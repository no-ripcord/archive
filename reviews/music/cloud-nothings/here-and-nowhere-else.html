  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Here and Nowhere Else - Cloud Nothings : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>There was a good while when I thought that Steve <span word="Albini’s" data-scaytid="1">Albini&rsquo;s</span> affiliation with Cloud Nothings would end up being more of a curse than a blessing. The legendary punk legend/producer/loud mouth was a central point of discussion regarding the band and their still glorious 2012 release <strong>Attack on Memory</strong>, which was engineered by <span word="Albini" data-scaytid="2">Albini</span>, and it seemed that a lion&rsquo;s share of the credit for Cloud Nothing&rsquo;s transformation from Dylan <span word="Baldi’s" data-scaytid="3">Baldi&rsquo;s</span> lo-fi bedroom-rock pet project to a full band indie rock powerhouse was given to <span word="Albini" data-scaytid="6">Albini</span> just for appearing in the credits. It seemed unfortunate that, despite <span word="Baldi’s" data-scaytid="5">Baldi&rsquo;s</span> claims that <span word="Albini" data-scaytid="11">Albini</span> basically sat at his <span word="soundboard" data-scaytid="16">soundboard</span> playing Scrabble on his phone during the recording sessions, <strong>Attack on Memory </strong>would be known to most more as an <span word="“Albini”" data-scaytid="17">&ldquo;Albini&rdquo;</span> record rather than a Cloud Nothings record, thus putting their newly built legacy in his hands as well.</p>
<p>But any thoughts that Cloud Nothings were simply <span word="“Albini-fied”" data-scaytid="18">&ldquo;Albini-fied&rdquo;</span> into a great band are quickly made obsolete with the torrential force of <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong>, in which <span word="Albini" data-scaytid="19">Albini</span> was swapped out of production duties for John <span word="Congleton" data-scaytid="21">Congleton</span>. Of course, equipping the guy who produced <strong>The Seer</strong> &ndash; perhaps the current decade&rsquo;s most intensely harrowing album yet &ndash; might still tempt some to pass on the credit, but doing so would only further insult the great strides <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="22">Baldi</span> &amp; Co. have made since they joined forces and transformed the Cloud Nothings agenda. From <span word="Baldi’s" data-scaytid="24">Baldi&rsquo;s</span> unimpeachable hooks to the furious, power chord-heavy guitar work to some of the most vital drumming heard on a rock record in years, everything on display in <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> is the work of a great band pulling out all the stops and proving they &ndash; and they alone &ndash; are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>I understand that many of the characteristics I just used to describe <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> &ndash; the hooks, the roaring guitars, the heart-racing drums &ndash; would aptly describe <strong>Attack on Memory</strong> pretty neatly, and it&rsquo;s true that the band stays firmly committed to their blend of indie pop, post hardcore, emo, and indie rock of the 90&rsquo;s persuasion. So yes, it&rsquo;s true that <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> doesn&rsquo;t have the same initial &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor of hearing <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="27">Baldi</span> screaming at the top, but Cloud Nothings still exhibit enough growth throughout to make for an even more exhilarating experience than previously.</p>
<p>For instance, despite being stripped to a single-guitar act and lacking that so-called <span word="“Albini" data-scaytid="29">&ldquo;Albini</span> magic&rdquo; this time around, the band overall sounds fuller and meaner. <span word="TJ" data-scaytid="30">TJ</span> Duke&rsquo;s bass has this sharp, elastic-y crunch to give it more distinction, and <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="33">Baldi</span> has adapted his guitar playing into something a bit more idiosyncratic but always filling in the spaces with lush, ringing distortion. Then, of course, there&rsquo;s drummer Jason <span word="Gerycz" data-scaytid="36">Gerycz</span>, whose kit seems to be constantly exploding with the force and brilliance of a firework display and whose expertly-timed fills sound like machine guns with the trigger jammed. Even <span word="Baldi’s" data-scaytid="38">Baldi&rsquo;s</span> voice, undoubtedly still carrying that snotty, bratty inflection you either love or hate, has developed an even grittier tone, and the rate at which the man bursts into a blood-curling scream is more frequent and sporadic than ever before. Ultimately, <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> is the sound of three musicians finally nailing their individual and collaborative voice to a T, and then just letting it all out with total abandon.</p>
<p>The biggest growth on display in <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong>, however, is in the songwriting department, as the band makes a conscious effort to keep things consistent and lively throughout. Despite <strong>Attack on Memory</strong> being stylistically rooted mainly in one place, it&rsquo;s easy to forget how many places Cloud Nothings managed to take that style in a mere eight songs. You had your all-out, monsoon inducing <span word="rager" data-scaytid="42">rager</span> (<em>Wasted Days</em>), your scrappy little <span word="twee-pop" data-scaytid="45">twee-pop</span> moment (<em>Fall In</em>), your manic-depressive &ldquo;ballad&rdquo; (<em>No Future/No Past</em>), and your dissonant, no BS sludge pit (<em>No Sentiment</em>), all with the same reference point but never even in the same area code.</p>
<p>While this was undoubtedly a selling point for <strong>Attack</strong>, it&rsquo;s nice to see <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="46">Baldi</span> and Co. pulling things more towards the center to make eight cohesive and constantly thrilling tracks, all of which carrying a unified thumb print but never blur together. Nothing ever quite scorches the earth with unabashed fury like <em>Wasted Days</em> or is as primarily catchy as <em>Fall In</em>, but stand outs like <em>Quieter Today</em>, <em>Just See Fear</em>, and <em>No Thought</em> instead take equal, vibrant dosages from both and squeezes them into distinct three-minute statements that are as irresistibly catchy as they are rabidly punishing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be tempting for naysayers to call the album formulaic or even boring in how rigidly Cloud Nothings stick with their three-minute 90&rsquo;s rock bombardments, but that would be ignoring just how effectively the band can still surprise when you least expect it. For instance, <em>Psychic Trauma</em> begins with a shimmering guitar lead and <span word="Baldi’s" data-scaytid="48">Baldi&rsquo;s</span> longing croon, but after an all-too unassuming 40 seconds, the tempo skyrockets and builds into one of the band&#39;s most rapturous and cathartic moments. Even more substantial &ndash; though less obvious &ndash; is <em>Patter Walks</em>, the album&#39;s eight minute epic, which seems to follow in the footsteps of counterpart <em>Wasted Days</em> until its last few minutes, bursting into a finale not scathing like its predecessor, but celebratory, with a bright, angelic melody casting the band&#39;s carnage in a warm rosy hue.</p>
<p>I remember hearing Dylan <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="50">Baldi</span> remarking that <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> is a much more positive record than <strong>Attack</strong> &ndash; that nothing bad was really going on in his life at the time and he basically wrote about what made him happy &ndash; and at first, I totally didn&rsquo;t buy it. With his guitar coated in uncompromising &nbsp;layers of distortion and lyrics that &ndash; while not as <span word="angsty" data-scaytid="52">angsty</span> as <strong>Attack</strong> &ndash; certainly contain their fair share of insecurity and uneasiness (&quot;<em>I can feel your pain and I feel alright about it</em>, <em>You don&rsquo;t really seem to care and I don&rsquo;t even talk about it</em>, <em>I&rsquo;m not telling you all I&rsquo;m going through</em>,&quot; etc.), <span word="Baldi" data-scaytid="55">Baldi</span> hardly comes off with much more of a sunny disposition this time around. But despite this, it&rsquo;s hard not to listen through <strong>Here and Nowhere Else</strong> with a smile on your face, as the hooks and instrumentation are just so incredibly lively and infectious it makes the whole album a momentous, front to back blast. Cloud Nothings might still be young and quite indebted to their 90&rsquo;s influences, but their latest shows they&rsquo;ve already mastered all the qualities of a truly great rock band and all of their contradictions: fury, angst, precision, sloppiness, <span word="catchiness" data-scaytid="57">catchiness</span>&nbsp;and, of course, fun.</p>
