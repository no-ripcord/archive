  <p>Great things are expected from artists who have continually given us great things in the past.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an inevitable cycle for musicians who constantly excel at delivering exactly what fans want, while also leaving some of those same fans to scratch their head in wonder.&nbsp; Just talk to bands like Radiohead or Liars who have released music which both exceeded their fans expectations and divided that same base.&nbsp; This seemingly purposeful drive to confound and impress their fans in equal measure is what drives so many artists into wild and unpredictable musical avenues.&nbsp; And so accordingly, Dan <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="2">Snaith</span> can be somewhat forgiven for releasing an album like <strong><span word="Jiaolong" data-scaytid="4">Jiaolong</span></strong>, which fails to come together in any manageable way, while also having released seminal albums like <strong>The Milk of Human Kindness</strong> and <strong>Up In Flames</strong> (under his Caribou and Manitoba monikers respectively).&nbsp; But an artist can&rsquo;t rely on the goodwill of their fans as a crutch for creative lethargy, and the bands which consistently end up impressing their fans understand this concept well.&nbsp; Unfortunately though, barring a few notable tracks, this debut from <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="5">Snaith</span> under the <span word="Daphni" data-scaytid="7">Daphni</span> name, fails to coalesce into anything resembling the creative designs of his previous records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His fascination with repetition, hinted at on earlier Caribou albums, comes to fruition here and does him no favors when it comes to creating memorable melodies and distinctive musical markers.&nbsp; The sequencing of <strong><span word="Jiaolong" data-scaytid="8">Jiaolong</span></strong> is also problematic but that could have been more easily forgiven had the quality of the songs been better.&nbsp; As they stand, there are moments on this record which are recognizably <span word="Snaithâ€™s" data-scaytid="10">Snaith&rsquo;s</span>, but the album feels disjointed and completely out of step with his past work, even for an album under a different musical alias.&nbsp; His fascination with samples, wonderfully understated and used to dramatic purpose on <strong>Swim</strong> and <strong>The Milk of Human Kindness</strong> fall flat and sound downright grating as they are used extensively in repetitive looping of simplistic beats and monosyllabic <span word="synth" data-scaytid="11">synth</span> lines.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care if he did preface this release by saying that it was a &ldquo;dance&rdquo; record.&nbsp; A good chunk of this album just feels lazy.</p>
<p>Opening track <em>Yes, I Know</em> turns a dramatic Buddy Miles sample into a soulless clinical construct, bereft of feeling and teetering on the verge of creative dismissal.&nbsp; And while that may seemly overly critical, I&rsquo;ve never found myself so ready to skip a track on any of his other records.&nbsp; There is something oddly off-putting about the way the song meanders without real purpose and attempts to shoehorn in this sample as a way of covering over its obvious lack of creative direction.&nbsp; It gives off an odd sensation of musical misdirection which seems incredibly deceptive, as it feels in no way earned.&nbsp; Follow-up track&nbsp;<em><span word="Cos-Ber-Zam" data-scaytid="15">Cos-Ber-Zam</span> &ndash; Ne <span word="Noya" data-scaytid="16">Noya</span> (<span word="Daphni" data-scaytid="12">Daphni</span> Mix)</em>&nbsp;takes an African poly-rhythmic vocal sample and runs roughshod over it by adding distractingly dull <span word="synths" data-scaytid="18">synths</span> and crude beats.&nbsp; When a decades-old sample can sound more vibrant and exciting than its surrounding music, there is obviously a fundamental problem with how the song is put together.&nbsp; And after over a decade of making substantial music from insubstantial bits and pieces, <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="14">Snaith</span> knows better than to half-ass it like he does on this track.&nbsp; What makes this seem more egregious than it might otherwise have been is that his electronic work has always been characterized by a natural, almost organic progression, and the total lack of any emotional core in these first two songs feels like a betrayal of his already well-established methodology.</p>
<p>Due to the unfortunate sequencing of these first two tracks, the album gets off to a rough start, with the music barely able to keep the listener engaged.&nbsp; Thankfully, we break ties with the first two tracks on <em>Ye Ye</em>, an energetically charged whirlpool of elastic beats and oscillating <span word="synths" data-scaytid="20">synths</span> that recalls some of the best moments from his past releases.&nbsp; It sprints along at a rapid pace, leaving empty husks of pre-amps and sequencers in its wake.&nbsp; This is what I expected from the man behind some of my favorite records of the past decade.&nbsp; I just have to wonder about his choices in regards to the track order&mdash;and album inclusion for that matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, those concerns can be shelved temporarily as the album&rsquo;s backbone, consisting of <em>Light</em> and <em>Pairs</em>, props up the album and manages to provide a brief glimpse of that devious collage-happy artist we&rsquo;ve come to know and trust.&nbsp; And though that trust is strained on <strong><span word="Jiaolong" data-scaytid="22">Jiaolong</span></strong>, there is enough here to satiate die-hard fans, though casual fans may find it a tough sell. &nbsp;<em>Light</em> pairs a <span word="motorik" data-scaytid="25">motorik</span> beat with laser beam <span word="synths" data-scaytid="24">synths</span> and a flute sample that manages to thread together seamlessly despite its superficial disparity.&nbsp; <em>Pairs</em> successfully combines an oddly arranged calypso rhythm with a throbbing bass line that twists around on itself while layering subtle <span word="synth" data-scaytid="27">synth</span> arrangements in the background.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great example of what <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="28">Snaith</span> is capable of when he&rsquo;s completely focused on the material at hand, which unfortunately is not the case on most of the songs here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality drops again on the back end with <em>Springs</em> and <em>Long</em> but doesn&rsquo;t quite hit the lows of the first few songs.&nbsp; If anything, it&rsquo;s a forgettable ending to a mostly disappointing album, as these last songs never really hit their stride in any meaningful way and just seen instantly unremarkable.&nbsp; Even the incessant tape hiss on <em>Long</em> that eventually morphs into aqueous squelches, as well as the spiked <span word="synths" data-scaytid="31">synths</span> on <em>Springs</em>, can&rsquo;t redeem an album so tied to constructed repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all the more disappointing as we were just beginning to hear what could be accomplished when all these jumbled pieces fall into place.</p>
<p>And though it may be unfair to judge <strong><span word="Jiaolong" data-scaytid="33">Jiaolong</span></strong> according to the rules set forth by <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="34">Snaith</span> in his day-band Caribou, it seems that the comparisons are as apt as they are unforgiving.&nbsp; He fooled around with synthetic repetition on <strong>Swim</strong>, but had the good sense to understand its limitations.&nbsp; As <span word="Daphni" data-scaytid="37">Daphni</span>, it seems as though he&rsquo;s cast off any creative (read: self-critical) confines and just let the notes run around from reel to reel, casting formless shadows across the tracks.&nbsp; The creative restraint that he exercised to exacting measure on <strong>Up In Flames</strong> and <strong>The Milk of Human Kindness</strong>, which is no way hindered his ability to extract perfect marvels of melody on those records, would have been a very welcome addition on these songs.&nbsp; And while the album does have a very solid mid-section, with <em>Ye Ye</em>, <em>Light</em>, and <em>Pairs</em> anchoring the creatively adrift <strong><span word="Jiaolong" data-scaytid="39">Jiaolong</span></strong>, it feels too scattered and thematically distant to ever feel like a true descendent of Caribou.&nbsp; And maybe it&rsquo;s not supposed to be but Dan <span word="Snaith" data-scaytid="40">Snaith</span> better light up the sky with his new release or his fans may simply turn to other artists for their electro-pop fix.&nbsp; At the very least, a trial separation from <span word="Daphni" data-scaytid="41">Daphni</span> might not be a bad idea.&nbsp; Now go listen to <strong>Up In Flames</strong> and just try to get that stupid grin off your face.</p>
