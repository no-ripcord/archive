  <h1 class="music-review-title">Frank Ocean <em>Channel ORANGE</em></h1>
  <strong class="label">(Mercury)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Channel ORANGE - Frank Ocean : 7/10" alt="Rating - 7/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/7.gif"/>
  <p>They say there&rsquo;s no such thing as bad publicity, but Frank Ocean might have a thing or two to say about that. Since he published a certain <span word="Tumblr" data-scaytid="2">Tumblr</span> post (which was initially planned to be included within <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> itself), he&rsquo;s become one of the most talked-about artists on the planet. There have been countless features, articles and <span word="op-ed" data-scaytid="4">op-ed</span> pieces about him, though depressingly few have focused primarily on his music. Sure, he&rsquo;s had some healthy record sales in the aftermath but you can&rsquo;t help but think that nobody would want the scrutiny of the media turned on them in such a fashion.</p>
<p>Ocean&rsquo;s <span word="Tumblr" data-scaytid="3">Tumblr</span> post and the ensuing hubbub revealed several things &ndash; notably that he writes absolutely beautifully &ndash; but it really said more about us than it did him. It told us that, despite it being 2012 (<em>2012?!</em>), who an artist fancies is still more newsworthy than the art they create. It told us that many people fall into two groups: homophobes and people who are so desperate to show they&rsquo;re not homophobic that they loudly congratulate themselves for being comfortable with the sexual preferences of others &ndash; &nbsp;you know, standard human <span word="behaviour" data-scaytid="6">behaviour</span> that you&rsquo;d hope would be the norm and needn&rsquo;t be accompanied by a fanfare of self-recognition. Finally, it taught us that, by and large, people have a poor understanding of the spectrum of human sexuality. Ocean had spoken about sleeping with women previously; therefore his falling in love with a man doesn&rsquo;t make him gay any more than eating a tofu burger makes you a vegetarian.</p>
<p>Of course, all this <span word="scandalised" data-scaytid="7">scandalised</span> whispering and <span word="hypothesising" data-scaytid="8">hypothesising</span> has overshadowed the release of this record and, in the rush to make a point or three, this review has fallen into the same trap as so many before it. <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> has been one of the most anticipated albums of the year and rightly so; on his 2011 <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="9">mixtape</span>, <strong>Nostalgia ULTRA</strong>, Ocean demonstrated that he&rsquo;s an exciting addition to the world of popular music, with a wealth of ideas and a willingness to experiment which far outstrips the majority of his R&amp;B peers. Such was &nbsp;the quality of <strong>Nostalgia ULTRA</strong>, it was difficult to keep three things in mind: that it was only a <span word="mixtape" data-scaytid="10">mixtape</span>, that he is affiliated with the controversial and violent hip-hop collective, Odd Future, and that with the style of music he makes, Ocean&rsquo;s contemporaries are actually acts like Usher and <span word="Ne-Yo" data-scaytid="12">Ne-Yo</span>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s most striking about <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> is how unlike most modern-day R&amp;B singers Frank Ocean is. His style, his vocals, his grammar and his unwillingness to self-mythologise are extraordinarily refreshing. In fact, Frank Ocean may be the only R&amp;B artist who you&rsquo;d like to hear talk about themselves more. This doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s entirely a closed book though; indeed, first track proper <em>Thinkin Bout You</em> displays a naked vulnerability that&rsquo;s as disarming as it is eloquent.</p>
<p>Throughout <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong>, Ocean shows what a good ear he has, as he pilfers from other musical genres and adapts them to fit his own style. Soul, funk, hip-hop, pop and blues are all subsumed into Ocean&rsquo;s world and become part of his polished <span word="aesthetic" data-scaytid="14">aesthetic</span>. The results aren&rsquo;t always as spectacular as you might expect &ndash; with a few notable exceptions, <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> is solid rather than spellbinding &ndash; but his magpie instincts look set to ensure his longevity. It&rsquo;s an incredibly strong album lyrically though; we may not know how autobiographical it all is, but there&rsquo;s a strong sense of a lack of <span word="fulfilment" data-scaytid="15">fulfilment</span>, especially when accompanied by copious amounts of wealth. <em>Sweet Life</em> (co-written with <span word="Pharrell" data-scaytid="16">Pharrell</span> Williams) builds into a huge chorus about someone who&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;had a housekeeper and a landscaper since [they] were born&rdquo;</em> before the haunting and melodious backing vocals frame the throwaway yet revealing line: <em>&ldquo;my TV ain&rsquo;t HD &ndash; that&rsquo;s too real&rdquo;</em>. Fellow Odd Future associate Earl Sweatshirt joins the pity party on the ponderous <em>Super Rich Kids</em> &ndash; <em>&ldquo;point my clicker at the tube / I prefer expensive news&rdquo;</em> &ndash; an almost satiric tune that threatens to end in tragedy (<em>&ldquo;We end our day up on the roof / I say I&rsquo;ll jump &ndash; I never do&rdquo;</em>). It&rsquo;s so incongruous against the crass commercialism and consuming greed that pervades so much of popular culture that it&rsquo;s astonishing.</p>
<p>Of course, we then have the mind-melting epic that is <em>Pyramids</em>; the track Ocean previewed in advance of this album (yet another unlikely move). For the uninitiated, <em>Pyramids </em>is a near ten-minute epic that starts life as a funk-induced behemoth captained by the catchiest riff you&rsquo;re likely to hear all year before imploding and finishing up as a smooth jam. However, there&rsquo;s far more to it than that. It&rsquo;s a morality tale; an intergalactic story of <span word="glamour" data-scaytid="17">glamour</span> and Ancient Egyptian excess that eventually morphs into a detached rumination on the daily grind of being a stripper. The pyramids are no longer a symbol of prosperity, but the local strip bar. Ocean repeats the phrase, <em>&ldquo;she&rsquo;s working at The Pyramids tonight&rdquo;</em>, with such frequency, that stripping sounds like the most humdrum and least appealing profession in the world (yet another shot in the eye for more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; R&amp;B tropes).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exhausting, exhilarating tour de force that&rsquo;s difficult to surpass and the album undoubtedly loses some steam after the zenith of <em>Pyramids</em>. Actually, it&rsquo;s fair to say that the last third or so of <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> is a little on the dull side. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with the songs on offer, but they have little to hook you in or get the pulse racing. The appearance of <span word="André" data-scaytid="18">André</span> 3000 on <em>Pink Matter</em> brings a welcome extra voice into play, but the business end of <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> is overlong and self-indulgent. By the time the album peters out with the <span word="lacklustre" data-scaytid="19">lacklustre</span> <em>End</em>, your attention will have likely wandered elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite its faults, <strong>Channel ORANGE</strong> still marks Frank Ocean out as an intriguing and exciting artist. It&rsquo;s a contradiction in many ways: a far-from-perfect album that suggests a long and prosperous career; an artist without an exceptional voice who looks like he will instead become an exceptional voice. We&rsquo;re going to be hearing a lot more about Frank Ocean in years to come &ndash; let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;re hearing about his music and let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s better than this.</p>
