  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Not Your Kind of People - Garbage : 5/10" alt="Rating - 5/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/5.gif"/>
  <p>Remember the <span word="90s" data-scaytid="3">90s</span>? Remember the Sega v. Nintendo console war, Hal Hartley movies and when The Simpsons was still the most flawless, peerless show on TV? Remember Garbage&#39;s self-titled debut album and the &quot;It&#39;s by the guy who produced <strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="4">Nevermind</span></strong>&quot; chatter that surrounded it?</p>
<p>No doubt that description garnered the fledgling act a fair amount of interest (and record sales), but it was, in fact, rather a case of an album being <span word="mis-sold" data-scaytid="5">mis-sold</span>. Despite the <span word="bigging" data-scaytid="6">bigging</span> up of the grunge links, Garbage were essentially a pop band, just with a dash of rugged guitar and a twist of bubble-gum spikiness, and were all the better for it. Coming right at the point where lumberjack chic was starting to be swapped for sportswear <span word="stylings" data-scaytid="7">stylings</span>, Shirley Manson&#39;s flame-haired temptress image was genuinely quite unique, and Queer, while not exactly playing up to the more radical definition of the term, proved a welcome respite from the unfortunate rise of &quot;<span word="laddism" data-scaytid="8">laddism</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Their comeback <strong>Not Your Kind of People</strong> is once again somewhat <span word="mis-sold" data-scaytid="9">mis-sold</span>. For a start seven years away really isn&#39;t that big of a deal for a group who, without fail, took three-to-four year gaps between albums. Secondly, in interviews Manson has been attempting to frame Garbage&#39;s return as vital in the current music-market, bemoaning a lack of girls with attitude. This however, is entirely at odds with the reality that 2011 was almost entirely dominated, both commercially and critically, by women.</p>
<p>This unwillingness to engage with today&#39;s music scene is very much held up in the contents of <strong>Not Your Kind of People</strong>, and it ain&#39;t necessarily a bad thing; such glossy, buzz-saw pop has been rarely spotted in recent years, and while opener <em>Automatic Systematic Habit</em> might only be a couple of adjectives short of being an <span word="Alanis" data-scaytid="11">Alanis</span> <span word="Morissette" data-scaytid="12">Morissette</span> track, it is a fun little burst of woman-scorned drama in the vein of (albeit not as good as) their debut&#39;s opener <em><span word="Supervixen" data-scaytid="13">Supervixen</span></em>. Also, while it seems that every artist going is currently <span word="clamouring" data-scaytid="14">clamouring</span> to get the right a la mode wobbly bits into their tracks, Garbage are still very much tied to Butch <span word="Vig&#039;s" data-scaytid="15">Vig&#39;s</span> all-middle, no-bass production (something that was very much debated around the <strong><span word="Nevermind" data-scaytid="10">Nevermind</span></strong> re-release last year, and which serves as a reminder of just how superfluous bass players were in the <span word="90s" data-scaytid="17">90s</span> - perhaps best exemplified by the Alex James pluck at the same note a bit while trying to look cool career model).</p>
<p>Contradictorily, this is <strong>Not Your Kind of People</strong>&#39;s biggest problem too. For all the interesting noises that the band have come up with in the studio, the production really doesn&#39;t do them any <span word="favours" data-scaytid="19">favours</span>, cramming them into a fairly narrow space and stripping them almost entirely of any sense of atmosphere. And while Garbage were clearly having a <span word="misereable" data-scaytid="20">misereable</span> time during the recording of their last album, <strong>Bleed Like Me</strong>, which in turn resulted in increased listener apathy, at least that misery resulted in something a bit different - the band may have always been a bunch of <span word="miseryguts" data-scaytid="21">miseryguts</span>, keen to point out that they were &quot;only happy when it&#39;s complicated&quot;, but they&#39;d never sounded quite so outright pissed off as they did there, and they don&#39;t here either. Instead what we get are eleven fairly consistent, sturdy tracks, but which can only offer up either carefully plotted retreads of where they&#39;ve been before (after <em>Milk</em>, <em>Sugar</em> sees them continue in their occasional series of trip-hop ballads inspired by staple foodstuffs, it&#39;s also probably the best track here), or innovations so slight that they&#39;re hardly noticeable (the attempt at an anti-war song on <em>Blood for Poppies</em>, is actually considerably less embarrassing than anticipated, thanks to it being presented as a bit of a wishy-washy character study, and, to be more enthusiastic, to it having a very good hook for a chorus). <em>Beloved Freak</em> is perhaps, in its own modest way, the closest they get to a leap forward; despite featuring the most blatant attempt at going over old ground (although the chorus of Big Bright World is so similar to The Cure&#39;s <em>Boys Don&#39;t Cry</em> that it surely can&#39;t be an accident) by interpolating the gospel standard <em>This Little Light of Mine</em> (much like they previously did with The Beach Boys&#39; <em>Don&#39;t Worry Baby</em>) and combining it with some admirably subtle choir effects to create something a little woozy, gentle and fairly mature. Although whether those are selling points for a pop-rock record is another matter entirely.</p>
<p>All griping aside, it&#39;s all enjoyable, and will probably go down better than their last two releases (other than that production, which renders every buzzing guitar about as powerful as a wasp rattling around inside a tin-can), but ultimately it&#39;s like any rekindling of an old relationship; it may feel comfortable, familiar, even fun now, but it&#39;ll only be a matter of time before every bad habit that you fell out over in the first place becomes impossible to ignore again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
