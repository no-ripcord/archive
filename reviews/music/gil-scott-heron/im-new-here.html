  <strong class="label">(XL Recordings)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for I&#039;m New Here - Gil Scott-Heron : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>If Gil Scott-Heron is anything other than brilliant, he&rsquo;s striking.&nbsp; My first exposure to Mr. Scott-Heron was through a greatest hits compilation, his song <i>Whitey On The Moon</i> a contained but irate dig at American expenditure and, for me, a window into that world of 1970s pre-hip-hop African American poetic dissidence.&nbsp; The words were great, but I was more taken with his delivery, Scott-Heron&rsquo;s jazzy articulation and his angry and youthful language finding resonance with his audience, but also with anyone willing to listen.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 The voice of Gil Scott-Heron signaled a creative and societal uprising, or at the very least a social consciousness within and outside of the inner city.&nbsp; Years later, the voices of Chuck D, Ice Cube and KRS-One would continue in such a tradition, though with living room televisions now tuned to MTV, and Run DMC&rsquo;s breakthrough to suburban youth funneling this new language into the otherwise sheltered communities outside the cities.<br />
 <br />
 The Revolution, at least hip-hop&rsquo;s revolution, was somewhat televised.<br />
 <br />
 <i><b>I&rsquo;m New Here</b></i>, Scott-Heron&rsquo;s first album since 1994&rsquo;s <i><b>Spirits</b></i>, features him as a redemptive soul with his best years behind him and his legend established.&nbsp; Produced by XL Recordings co-owner, Richard Russell, <i><b>I&rsquo;m New Here</b></i> is an unimaginatively trip-hoppy (though remarkably personal) reintroduction to Scott-Heron, who spent the better part of this past decade in prison or struggling with drug abuse.&nbsp; Pieced together over the last two years, the album features snippet-length comments from Scott-Heron about parents, who he is and what he has coming to him.&nbsp; Then, you get the man in action, either scraping blues syllables from his throat with Robert Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Me And The Devil</i>, deeply waxing poetic about lost evenings alone (<i>Where Did The Night Go</i>) or offering tribute to a life &ldquo;guided by women&rdquo; (<i>On Coming From A Broken Home (Parts 1 &amp; 2)</i>).&nbsp; His voice a weathered and worn device, there are facets to his personality that seem to make this album work, when otherwise its disjointed presentation would seem haphazard or pasted together.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also very short, clocking in at shy of thirty minutes despite its fifteen tracks.<br />
 <br />
 In possible acknowledgement of the torch being passed on, hip-hop being the closest equivalent to Scott-Heron&rsquo;s craft these days, the album&rsquo;s bookends, <i>On Coming From A Broken Home (Parts 1 &amp; 2)</i>, sample Kanye West&rsquo;s <i>Flashing Lights</i>.&nbsp; Scott-Heron tells the story of growing up without a male figure in his life, but having the strength of his grandmother to guide him and his mother&rsquo;s sacrifices to teach him.&nbsp; He delivers his lines with an underlying gratitude that won&rsquo;t necessarily mine a listener&rsquo;s tears, but ably communicates his love and respect.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s aware that ears will hear this, so his speech is eulogy-like: informing, but devotional.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 With an urban beat propelling Robert Johnson blues, <i>Me And The Devil</i> finds Scott-Heron modernized for the Internet age.&nbsp; He sounds appropriately old, which is what makes <i>Me And The Devil</i> so powerful.&nbsp; Certainly the beats have been heard time and time again, but his emotional push is captivating and the mortality he exudes is thick enough to see.&nbsp; This is only confirmed by his version of Smog&rsquo;s <i>I&rsquo;m New Here</i>, where Scott-Heron manages to personalize the song with a somewhat mumbling verbalization of Bill Callahan&rsquo;s words:<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;No matter how far wrong you&rsquo;ve gone, you can always turn around.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 As covers go, for art or life, it&rsquo;s perfect.<br />
 <br />
 Over electro-pulsations, <i>Your Soul And Mine</i> revisits Scott-Heron&rsquo;s <i>The Vulture</i> from his album, <i><b>Small Talk At 125th and Lenox</b></i>.&nbsp; He gets soulful with Brook Benton&rsquo;s <i>I&rsquo;ll Take Care Of You</i> and nervous energy follows with <i>Where Did The Night Go</i>, detailing his struggle to write a letter to his anonymous &ldquo;baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>New York Is Killing Me</i> decries the luster of city life, a clap-a-long and soul choir there to soften Scott-Heron&rsquo;s caustic and bluesy throat.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 Particularly engaging is <i>Running</i>, where Scott-Heron talks himself in circles while communicating a certain futility in &ldquo;escape.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then haunts with <i>The Crutch</i>, a <i><b>Mezzanine</b></i>-like beat adding a loud severity to the words.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 Having read other reviews of this album, Gil Scott-Heron&rsquo;s association with Richard Russell has been compared to the partnership between Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin that brought about the <i><b>American Recordings</b></i> series.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not an inaccurate assessment, as both artists, with the aid of producers, shed their former selves and face(d) their respective future.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 In Scott-Heron&rsquo;s wake, hip-hop was birthed, raised and unceremoniously twisted into a commercialized and over-polished by-product of its former self.&nbsp; You get a sense that inasmuch as he allows modern beats and production to drive his poetry, as a hip-hop forefather, or &ldquo;godfather,&rdquo; the genre only has relevance so long as he continues to thrive.&nbsp; (Or, so long as the genre can claim an intellect, which is difficult to find these days.&nbsp; At least, from a mainstream standpoint.)&nbsp; It almost seems as if, while Scott-Heron lost his way, so did hip-hop, a directionless child seeking and requiring guidance while its older and wiser brothers and sisters, closer in age to its progenitors, only offered judgment or comment.&nbsp; <br />
 <br />
 With <i><b>I&rsquo;m New Here</b></i>, Scott-Heron isn&rsquo;t there to judge anyone.&nbsp; On the contrary, in a way, he&rsquo;s seeking absolution for his mistakes, but not for his past or his present.&nbsp; One of the interludes, <i>I've Been Me</i>, says it best:<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been as eccentric, as obnoxious, as arrogant, as aggressive, as introspective, as selfish, I wouldn&rsquo;t be me.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be who I am.&rdquo;</p>
