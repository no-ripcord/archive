  <p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">For a band not known for their words, Godspeed You! Black Emperor really do seem to do a lot with their choice of them; from their rare, carefully considered interviews, to their sloganeering statements and the samples of <span word="monologues" data-scaytid="1">monologues</span> and street recordings that </span>frequently pepper<span lang="EN-US"> their recorded output.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">So after four albums (</span>that the group have unleashed on the public at least<span lang="EN-US">), one EP</span>, plentiful side projects <span lang="EN-US">and two decades, </span>just <span lang="EN-US">how does one approach their first record to eschew all of that? The seemingly random, semi-profound and poetic song titles might be all present and correct (the likes of<em> Piss Crowns are Trebled</em> make no more sense the longer, or shorter, that you look at </span>them,<span lang="EN-US"> but they always feel like there</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s some sort of meaning there somewhere), but the rest of the language has all been stripped away for the first time. Perhaps it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s no coincidence that this slight withdrawal follows in the wake of their <span word="much-criticised" data-scaytid="4">much-criticised</span> criticism of the Polaris Music Prize and its corporate sponsorship</span>?</p>
<p class="Body">At first<span lang="EN-US">, the effect is somewhat disorienting. <strong>Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress</strong> may be in theory familiar </span>&ndash; <span lang="EN-US">perhaps overly so, having been performed frequently live in its entirety since before the release of 2012</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span>s <strong><span word="Allejuah" data-scaytid="5">Allejuah</span>! Don<span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"><strong>t Bend! Ascend!,</strong>&nbsp;commonly referred to among the band&#39;s fans and bootleggers as &quot;Behemoth&quot; - however,&nbsp;<span word="th" data-scaytid="6">th</span></span>ere is still a sense of listening in a vacuum; that navigating the monumental sweeps and swoops of Godspeed&#39;s semi-orchestral sound can be a daunting prospect when not given the helpful shorthand as to what you&#39;re meant to be feeling at any point. And maybe that&#39;s because this is because this is meant to be an entirely vague work; where before the band were obliquely railing against specific problems and events, now they&#39;re just concerned with capturing the (beautiful) melancholy of resistance, as the almost giddily breathless run-on sentence emblazoned inside the record&#39;s packaging, &quot;We love you so much our country is fucked&quot;, would suggest.</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">What is immediately apparent, however, is how much </span>the work <span lang="EN-US">borrows and develops from the band</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="8">catalogue</span>. It might owe most at first to <strong><span word="Allejuah" data-scaytid="7">Allejuah</span>!</strong>... drawing on that record</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s structure (two longer movements separated by two drone pieces), and, in first track, <em>Peasantry or </em></span><em>&ldquo;<span lang="EN-US">Light! Inside of Light!</span>&rdquo;&#39;s</em>&nbsp;similarly explicitly<span lang="EN-US"> nods to Eastern European folk music in its string filigrees</span>. But<span lang="EN-US"> it reduces the ingredients of that record right down - </span>if you thought that the record&#39;s title offered something of a clue as to how best approach it, then you&#39;d be left none the wiser on hearing <em>Asunder, Sweet </em>itself - <span lang="EN-US">a drone so minimal</span>, even by the usual standards of drone-based composition - <span lang="EN-US">that it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s effectively a violin mid-tuning.</span></p>
<p class="Body">The fact that the record is their shortest since their earliest releases also seems like a key point to consider. That the band have, over the course of the years, and the departure and return of members come to the point that they feel so comfortable and confident in their sound that they don&#39;t need any of the extra maximalist touches they&#39;d become known for over the years (although the return of certain tricks - such as the locked groove on the vinyl edition, recalling debut <em>F#A# infinity</em>, are welcome nods to their early days).&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">Where it does differ from the patchwork-like nature of their early work is in the sense of how considered it is. Despite always being presented as a complete single work, the album has been painstakingly recorded and refined (not for nothing do the liner notes describe the album as being </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">writ, wrung and ruined</span><span>&hellip; </span><span lang="EN-US">during all four seasons of 2013 &amp; 2014</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">). Even the album</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s release seems to be something that</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s been much thought about, given the time that it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s taken between recording and release, and it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s all the better for it.</span></p>
<p class="Body"></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In a live setting, <em>Behemoth</em> could be a bit of a drag, not because of unfamiliarity </span>&ndash; <span lang="EN-US">Godspeed fans are well acquainted with large chunks of an evening</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s set-list being taken up with unknown tracks, it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s what they</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">ve always done (and indeed are still doing on their current tour) - but the 40+ minutes of the track could be a bit much to get one</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s teeth into. As <strong>Asunder Sweet and Other Distress</strong> however, the work hasn</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">t seemingly been cut, but it has been tightened up in places, coming in about five minutes shorter.&nbsp; On the surface the record is rock </span>&lsquo;n<span lang="FR">&rsquo; </span><span lang="EN-US">roll, all volume and aggression, but the sense of painstaking refinement and being allowed to mature seems very much against the spontaneity that defines the form. The album frequently descends into seemingly chaotic feedback and amp fuzz but the dirt is very much artfully, deliberately applied.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Not that </span>&lsquo;<span lang="EN-US">restraint</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo; </span><span lang="EN-US">is really the word that springs instantly to mind when discussing the work of the nine-piece band. But</span> they&#39;ve never sounded quite so in control of their sound as they do at points here. During <em>Piss Crowns</em>... the<span lang="EN-US"> band expand and contract their </span>sound, moving in and out of sync (always intentionally). Post-rock may have been somewhat mocked as being all about the crescendo and quiet-loud-quiet-LOUD structures, but it&#39;s never been quite so effectively deployed in the controlled chaotic rush of the track&#39;s five minute mark &nbsp;And then a few minutes later the band outdo even that, capturing a spiraling loop of pretty ferocity, where each member is pulling together, but remaining equal and distinct in their own right (something that the guitar-focused sound of their previous works never quite managed), before pulling apart and gradually winding down.</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">How long it</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US"><span word="ll" data-scaytid="10">ll</span> take before the band to feel suitably prepared for their next public communication remains to be seen. It might be the case that, given the time it takes for the band to come together and slowly chip away at their work to hone it into the correct shape, that we </span>might not even get to hear it in an officially sanctioned studio created manner <span lang="EN-US">(they might already be performing new material in their current live sets, but then much of <strong><span word="Allejuah" data-scaytid="11">Allejuah</span>!</strong> was being performed live a decade before it was finally recorded and released). But ultimately, that doesn</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span>t matter &ndash; <span lang="EN-US">the band might well still be fluctuating and developing, but, at least in parts on <strong>Asunder</strong></span>&hellip; <span lang="EN-US">they&#39;ve truly perfected their sound, and there</span><span lang="FR">&rsquo;</span><span lang="EN-US">s not many bands that that can be said about.</span></p>
