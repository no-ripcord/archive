  <strong class="label">(Tri-Angle)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for With U - Holy Other : 8/10" alt="Rating - 8/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/8.gif"/>
  <p>What we know about Holy Other can be summed up in a few clauses: he&#39;s either a Berliner or a <span word="Mancunian" data-scaytid="42">Mancunian</span>, he plays with a black cloth over his head, and this year he released an EP called <strong>With U</strong> on Tri-Angle records. I&#39;ve never been to one of his live shows, but thanks to YouTube I watched him play at the Rewire festival, in the Hague. It was excellent and strange; that fucking cloth makes me wonder how he sees the buttons he presses &ndash; the place is so dark. The atmosphere seemed cold, digital &ndash; funereal, befit for a requiem.</p>
<p>Because I believe that <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="43">dubstep</span> is where the new music is at, its state (you can substitute that word for other abstract nouns like health, body, form, et al.) constantly intrigues me, but I also know I am at a fault for being such a detective about it, because it operates in Europe, mostly in England, and I live in Brooklyn. So when <span word="4AD" data-scaytid="46">4AD</span> releases <strong>The Vision</strong> by the Joker, a horrible record that&#39;ll be forgotten in a month, for sure, and it gets all this turgidity that he&#39;ll &ldquo;eventually gain massive crossover appeal,&rdquo; I&#39;m wondering if American audiences are being fooled, that perhaps the Joker won a lottery held in London called The New <span word="Dubstep" data-scaytid="47">Dubstep</span> Artist for America! You&#39;d think the World Wide Web offers a solution to this whole living across the pond deal, but it doesn&#39;t; it makes <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="44">dubstep</span> doubly elusive, plagued with mass-media marketing and sociological inconsistencies. Then I&#39;ve got this gem of an EP by the next I&#39;m-Not-Showing-My-Face producer (Burial, <span word="Zomby" data-scaytid="48">Zomby</span>, Holy <span word="Other...there" data-scaytid="49">Other...there</span> will be others) to deal with. It&#39;s no doubt the best EP of 2011, but where did it come from?</p>
<p>First: who the fuck is going around calling records <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="50">post-dubstep</span>? Post- anything is defined in my Oxford-American Dictionary as &ldquo;after, in time or <span word="order.”" data-scaytid="51">order.&rdquo;</span> But isn&#39;t <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="45">dubstep</span> occurring right now? Or did I miss it? Did it die? Or what? Names of genres and their history have always been problematic. They say punk was birthed in 1977, a time when The Clash and The Sex Pistols were making records. But listening to Funhouse by <span word="Iggy" data-scaytid="52">Iggy</span> Pop and The Stooges, released in 1970, and <span word="MC5&#039;s" data-scaytid="53">MC5&#39;s</span> Kick Out The Jams, out a year earlier, suggests otherwise. Post-punk (Joy Division, The Cure, Gang of Four) still had passion, but were more depressed and existential &ndash; it&#39;s apparent in the lyrics, the fashion, how they played live with less aggression, blah blah blah. Of course, the artists themselves don&#39;t care about the pigeon-holing, but I sure do.</p>
<p>I mention all this punk, post-punk rambling to compare it to <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="65">dubstep</span> and <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="67">post-dubstep</span>. I&#39;m listening to <span word="Skream" data-scaytid="69">Skream</span>, who I safely assume is a <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="66">dubstep</span> producer, not <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="68">post-dubstep</span>, and I hear its grime, the upbeat, how danceable his songs are. And now, Holy Other. It&#39;s slower, more emotional, deeper. Compare it to post-punk&#39;s lesser amount of aggression, if you will. It gets me wondering: if all music has to do is slow its tempo down, does that change its genre? Post-hardcore becomes <span word="emo...big" data-scaytid="70">emo...big</span> band becomes <span word="cool...well" data-scaytid="71">cool...well</span>, I think it&#39;s a trend, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a shift. Part of why <span word="dubstep&#039;s" data-scaytid="72">dubstep&#39;s</span> sudden stylistic and abrupt permutations are occurring is because at its center, it is a <span word="traditionless" data-scaytid="73">traditionless</span> music, devoid of years and years of history to build upon, to cage it in nostalgic timidity. Another big reason: computers, turntables, loop generators and the rest are getting simpler while offering more complex options for recording music easier.</p>
<p>So: Holy Other might be a <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="83">post-dubstep</span> producer. It&#39;s up in the air, but the mutation of <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="84">dubstep</span> and its live show isn&#39;t. <span word="Lizzi" data-scaytid="85">Lizzi</span> <span word="Bougatsos" data-scaytid="86">Bougatsos</span> of Gang Gang Dance, in the November 2011 issue of The Wire, wrote about dub shows, saying: &ldquo;All the lights are down and you&#39;re just feeling it. No one can see each other, people are freaking out and the lights are down and no one can see <span word="you.”" data-scaytid="87">you.&rdquo;</span> That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m seeing on that YouTube clip of Holy Other at Rewire. Funny how in the video, I don&#39;t see anyone, but I hear a din of whispers coming from behind the camera, which isn&#39;t close to Holy Other at all. Regardless if the place was packed or not, if I were there, experiencing a psychotic reaction from snorting too much molly, I doubt people would notice me, or give a shit. On the other hand, watching <span word="Skream" data-scaytid="88">Skream</span> perform in 2009, I see tons of people, drenched in neon led lights, tripping out. Tons of drunk girls, sweaty bodies, hands waving in the air, big beats. People are on drugs and you can see who&#39;s fucked up and who isn&#39;t. Strange how different an audience is when you slow down the meter and turn off the lights.</p>
<p>There are two species of <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="95">dubstep</span>, but I don&#39;t think one precedes the other. <span word="Zomby" data-scaytid="97">Zomby</span> drops <strong>Dedication</strong> this year, closer to what <span word="Skream&#039;s" data-scaytid="98">Skream&#39;s</span> doing, just a bit more melodic. Burial drops <strong>Street Halo</strong>, which is more of what Holy Other is about. The necessity to have the choice of going for big beats and grime with the alternative of slower, more intricate, intimate music has always been a choice for all types of music. In the end, it all goes back to major and minor tonalities &ndash; feeling happy or sad. Timothy Leary said that there are two acid trips: the extroverted (in his words: &ldquo;one should bring to the session: candles, pictures, books, incense, music, or recorded passes to guide the awareness in the desired direction&rdquo;) and the introverted (&ldquo;no light, no sound, no smell, no <span word="movement.”" data-scaytid="99">movement.&rdquo;</span>) <span word="Dubstep" data-scaytid="100">Dubstep</span> and post <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="96">dubstep</span> are kind of like those two types of acid trips, respectively.</p>
<p>No light, no sound, no smell, no movement. But there is sound. Like Burial and Andy <span word="Stott" data-scaytid="101">Stott</span>, Holy Other&#39;s music samples vocals and distorts their timbres to produce speech-like sounds: moans, grumbles, cut-off words &ndash; and he loops them until orgasmic ecstasy. Beats are still layered underneath, <span word="sidechained" data-scaytid="102">sidechained</span> under <span word="echos" data-scaytid="103">echos</span>, MIDI and other <span word="electroacoustic" data-scaytid="104">electroacoustic</span> experiments. <strong>With U</strong>&#39;s atmosphere is as dark as a bad break-up in the middle of winter. The <span word="BPMs" data-scaytid="105">BPMs</span> loop slowly. It repeats samples and interjects sad R&amp;B-sounding voices into the mix. Some of these voices are in a deep register &ndash; a huge weeping giant. A high-registered voice usually accompanies this giant, to both provide variety in the song structure as well as insinuate some sort of tragic duet &ndash; a Romeo and Juliet argument through text messages. And lastly, the song titles: <em><span word="Yr" data-scaytid="154">Yr</span> Love</em>, <em>With U</em>, <em>Feel Something</em>. It&#39;s nothing but deeply romantic, cathartic, contemplative, and destructive.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just the hooks of the songs that make this EP so bewitching, it&#39;s also a prophecy for <span word="post-dubstep" data-scaytid="121">post-dubstep</span>. This is what it&#39;s all going to sound like the next couple of years, I know. The computer age was never the age of stronger connections between friends and family, despite our mouse-tap culture of instant gratification. In time, it will be written in the history books that this age was that of ghostliness and disconnection, an age where, as the artist Paul Chan wrote, &ldquo;one can be surrounded by, and in contact with anyone and everyone, and still feel inexplicably <span word="abandoned.”" data-scaytid="122">abandoned.&rdquo;</span> Perhaps Holy Other&#39;s black cloth is a metaphor for the alienation an artist has with their audience. Thus his music is a paradox: it so easily establishes a connection with his listeners but its themes are about break-up and separation.</p>
<p>We experience communication with others differently from that of the past, and the same goes with music. Holy Other&#39;s sound is &ldquo;a voice that desires a reply [that] sounds different than an echo that wants attention&rdquo; (Chan again.) In the words of <span word="Ashbery" data-scaytid="133">Ashbery</span>: &ldquo;For the speed of light is far away, / and you, sooner or later, must return / to a deteriorated <span word="situation.”" data-scaytid="132">situation.&rdquo;</span> Or we return to Holy Other&#39;s music, and perhaps grasp what is embedded and entangled in it: our moment right now.</p>
