  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for The Path Of Totality - Korn : 1/10" alt="Rating - 1/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/1.gif"/>
  <p>When presented with something like Korn&#39;s attempt at a &#39;dubstep&#39; record I suppose the only appropriate response is to laugh, not least because its release has been accompanied with numerous lol-worthy statements from <span word="frontman" data-scaytid="6">frontman</span> Jonathan Davies. Admittedly, his claim that the band weren&#39;t interested in making &ldquo;gay techno music&rdquo; was the very definition of the Neanderthal knuckle dragging that typified the &#39;nu-metal&#39; attitude, as was his take on the recession (&quot; I wish everyone would shut the fuck up and have some fun. Every day I&#39;ve got to hear about unemployment and people starving&quot;), but his claims that the band had somehow managed to invent both nu metal and <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="3">dubstep</span>, as well as some completely new genre that he chose to call &quot;future metal&quot; (whatever that is), or his attacking his own fans for being &quot;stuck in 1994? Absolutely hilarious; after all this is a band who found a fan-base solely by providing teenage boys with the opportunity to let off some steam, essentially being the aural equivalent of furious masturbation. Their only significant cultural contribution being that they&#39;ve convinced some of those same boys that all you need to be in a successful band is angst, <span word="manky-looking" data-scaytid="7">manky-looking</span> dreadlocks and an over-reliance on drop D tuning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not so easy to laugh at <strong>The Path Of Totality</strong> if you actually have to listen to it, as Davies&#39; endless whining, self-obsessed, baseless anger gets old spectacularly quickly. Even worse, his attitudes aren&#39;t just amusingly backward, or delivered with a total lack of finesse (<em>Tension</em> sees him make a very late stab at the title of worst lyric of the year with the lines &quot;I&#39;m terrified by emotionless faces/They&#39;re all around me I want to die/I&#39;m fucking <span word="trippin" data-scaytid="8">trippin</span>&#39; out seeing traces/Of murderers covered in lye&quot;) but arguably dangerous - if its not the spectacularly misguided approach to politics on Get Up or the about-as-deep-as-a-Dan Brown-novel Illuminati, its the rampant misogyny that runs unchecked through much of the album, most appallingly in <em>Chaos Lives In Everything</em>&#39;s &quot;<span word="Gonna" data-scaytid="9">Gonna</span> take you/<span word="Gonna" data-scaytid="10">Gonna</span> break you/<span word="Gonna" data-scaytid="11">Gonna</span> rape you, fuck you bitch&quot;. Of course I&#39;m not suggesting that Korn are advocating sexual assault; it is a necessity that art can sometimes go to unsettling, even repugnant places, but it should be the artist&#39;s responsibility to find a reason to justify such indulgences and unfortunately Davies is too busy feeling sorry for himself to take any interest in that - the rest of the song, and indeed much of the album, reading merely like the <span word="rantings" data-scaytid="12">rantings</span> of the sexually repressed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, musically speaking <strong>The Path Of Totality</strong> is nowhere near as bad. Despite Korn hooking up with <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="13">dubstep</span> (but not really &ndash; more on that in a minute) artists seeming like the most laughably misguided idea since, well, Lou Reed decided to put a metal spin on some songs he wrote about a certain fin de <span word="si" data-scaytid="15">si</span><span word="ècle" data-scaytid="16">ècle</span> prostitute, actually, they blend in quite well together. Korn have always been rather interested in the low end of their records so the grinding <span word="basslines" data-scaytid="17">basslines</span> provided by their collaborators seem like a fairly natural fit.</p>
<p>It should also be said that the artists complement each other well as they are all both incredibly formulaic and as subtle as a brick to the face; Korn&#39;s idea of <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="18">dubstep</span> being not the adventurous, evocative sounds of Burial, <span word="Zomby" data-scaytid="24">Zomby</span>, or <span word="Benga" data-scaytid="25">Benga</span>, but rather the brash, it must be said mostly American, off-shoot often referred to as &#39;<span word="brostep" data-scaytid="26">brostep</span>&#39;. Without wanting to seem like too much of a possessive dick about it, I do question whether <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="19">dubstep</span> is, like punk, something that really only the British can pull off, as, like thirty years ago when the nation&#39;s disaffected youth took the germs of a genre from America and twisted it into something even more savage and raw, <span word="dubstep" data-scaytid="20">dubstep</span> is essentially a corruption of the brightness of American R&amp;B, refracted through the prism of British urban decay, something which Korn and the <span word="brosteppers" data-scaytid="27">brosteppers</span> haven&#39;t really managed to grasp. Consequently, while never embarrassing, nothing here has much in the way of depth (perhaps coincidentally, perhaps not, the closest the album comes to subtlety is <em>Bleeding Out</em>, a collaboration with the British producer Feed Me, although it might just seem that way as they brought in a piano for the intro).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most upsetting thing about the album is that it confirms that, however odious the man and his image might be, <span word="Skrillex" data-scaytid="28">Skrillex</span> actually does possess some talent. Amidst the rather impersonal, functional selection of beats, his contributions do genuinely stand out;&nbsp;<em>Narcissistic Cannibal</em> with its rave-like sirens and grind-saw buzzing (which to be honest could describe pretty much every <span word="Skrillex" data-scaytid="29">Skrillex</span> track) and even some pretty decent vocals from Davies in its insistently melodic chorus, is actually a fairly adequate song. It might have even been a good one had it not been named &#39;Narcissistic Cannibal&#39; and if it didn&#39;t feature the 40 year old millionaire Davies going on about how &quot;Everything&#39;s wrong every time&quot; (frankly, it&#39;s a bit rich of him to accuse his fans of being stuck in the past).</p>
<p>It would be wrong to say that <strong>The Path Of Totality</strong> is totally worthless as it pretty much sets out in what it aims to do: the low end&#39;s fine and angry teenagers will still be able to punch their bedroom walls or <span word="wank" data-scaytid="31">wank</span> off to it if they are that way inclined (although they&#39;d have to do so in a slightly frenetic, polyrhythmic, rather uncomfortable way). But it is <span word="samey" data-scaytid="32">samey</span>, ugly and spectacularly stupid at the same time, and even more <span word="damningly" data-scaytid="33">damningly</span>, when compared to this year&#39;s other unlikely metal collaboration, it makes<strong> Lulu</strong> seem like the height of good taste. &nbsp;</p>
