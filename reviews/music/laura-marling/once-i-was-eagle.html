  <strong class="label">(Virgin)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Once I Was An Eagle - Laura Marling : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>At 23 years of age, Laura Marling has released four albums, and each is better than the last. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand: If you want to hear Laura Marling&rsquo;s best songs, look elsewhere, specifically to 2011&rsquo;s <strong>A Creature I Don&rsquo;t Know</strong>. But if you want to hear a songwriter truly come into her own, change up the game, and unleash one of the most rewarding and promising folk albums&mdash;or rather, Album, with a capital A&mdash;since the heyday of the usual name-checks, it&rsquo;s hard to call anything other than <strong>Once I Was An Eagle </strong>her best.</p>
<p>At the same time, this probably won&rsquo;t be Marling&rsquo;s best work. It has its share of noticeable flaws. The first four songs bleed together so unnoticeably that it&rsquo;s impossible to overlook that the rest of the first half of the album, bisected by a cello interlude courtesy Ruth de <span word="Turberville" data-scaytid="2">Turberville</span>, all plays like individual songs.&nbsp; For another, the album&rsquo;s back half is noticeably stronger on a song-to-song basis than the first half, which threatens to tear apart the conceptual unity of the album. Third, despite being an exceptionally quick 65 minutes, 65 minutes without a great deal of variation is a nigh-impossible task for a folk album. In Marling&rsquo;s defense, this is probably the closest anyone has come: <strong>Blue </strong>and <strong>Nebraska</strong>, its cousins in that regard, are considerably shorter than <strong>Once I Was An Eagle</strong>, which works both to this album&rsquo;s advantage and disadvantage. Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Nick Drake, and even Bob Dylan rarely, if ever, made albums this long, and when they did (<strong>The River </strong>or <strong>Blonde On Blonde</strong>), they were marked by eccentricity. In other words, Marling is pushing the genre into territory charted only by Josh T. Pearson, a radically different songwriter, and late-era Dylan. That the album is broken apart by <em>Interlude</em> suggests that she is doing so with a great deal of awareness and purpose. It would be one thing if the ambition spiraled out of control, or if the length was irksome. In fact, it&rsquo;s noticeable only when you start to uncover other treasures. It&rsquo;s the best flaw an album could have.</p>
<p>There are two primary things that make <strong>Once I Was An Eagle </strong>take flight: Lyrics and progression, which together make the album intelligent, confident, and, perhaps most importantly, recursive. Nearly song has a verse or a couplet that displays a stunning amount of maturity and awareness. In <em>Once I Was An Eagle</em>, she follows &ldquo;when we were in love&rdquo; with the subversive &ldquo;if we were,&rdquo; a seemingly simple gesture that is strengthened by Marling&rsquo;s delivery. Writing a break-up album is one thing&mdash;and <strong>Once I Was An Eagle </strong>very much is a break-up album, albeit one of the most hopeful by the end&mdash;but writing a break-up album and questioning whether it&rsquo;s even a love album in the second song is something completely different. In the angry <em>You Know</em>, the speaker lashes out at her victimizers for four verses only to lose control upon being asked if she was ever a child. It takes eight tracks, until the delicate and beautiful <em>Once</em>, for her to move away from uncertainty and bitterly respond in the affirmative, adding that it was <em>&ldquo;when all I didn&rsquo;t know need doing had been done.&rdquo; </em>And this in a song which, combined with <em>I Was An Eagle</em>, we hear the claim <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve damn near got no dignity left,&rdquo;</em> the album takes its title from? <em>Once</em>&rsquo;s other lyrical dagger comes with understated simplicity in the chorus: <em>&ldquo;once, once is enough to break your heart/once, once is enough to make you think twice/about laying your little love out on the line.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the simple lyrics of <strong>Once I Was An Eagle </strong>that stick out the most. Two basic rules of writing are &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; and &ldquo;say whatever you have to say in as few words as possible.&rdquo; Marling has mastered the latter, and her delivery accounts for the former, so even title lines like <em>&ldquo;When were you happy and how long has that been?&rdquo;</em> pack an unexpected punch. In the final song, a bitter sarcasm takes over when she says<em> &ldquo;thank you naivety for failing me again,&rdquo;</em> but the threat <em>&ldquo;you were my next verse&rdquo;</em> lingers just as strong.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the final song, the album has moved from a place of self-defeat to profound awareness and bitter acceptance. The album&rsquo;s first half is heavy on minor-keys, regret, and blame, swearing off romance in <em>I Was An Eagle</em> and empowering oneself as a <em>Master Hunter </em>in another. The second half, however, subtly introduces more instruments, and so the images of the sea that are sprinkled throughout the album are not nighttime images but daytime ones. <em>Undine</em>, which could fit just as well <strong>Alas I Cannot Swim </strong>or <strong>A Creature I Don&rsquo;t Know</strong> because of its literary images and emphasis on storytelling, provides a separation from the album&rsquo;s heartbreak. <em>Where Can I Go? </em>is among the most upbeat tracks and the only one that truly sounds like Joni Mitchell. On <em>Pray For Me,&nbsp;</em>she distances herself from the devil in the chorus but admits that <em>&ldquo;where he runs, I run in tow,&rdquo;</em> an improvement over <em>Devil&rsquo;s Resting Place</em>, where she claimed to <em>&ldquo;go with the devil where the devil rests his face.&rdquo;</em> At this point, she&rsquo;s trying to break away. And indeed, one song about being happy as opposed to miserable and then, with <em>Love Be Brave</em>, the album reaches a clear turning point as the persona finally begins to empathize. That song&rsquo;s second verse may be the entire album&rsquo;s best, displaying a sense of external awareness with simple, evocative poetic images before leading to acceptance and empowerment. <em>&ldquo;Here comes a change over me/something strange takes over me/I am brave and love is sweet,&rdquo;</em> she says.</p>
<p>Again in <em>I Was An Eagle</em>, Marling sings <em>&ldquo;every little girl is so naïve.&rdquo;</em> <em>Undine </em>pleads to become more <span word="naïve" data-scaytid="4">naïve</span>, as if savoring the childish innocence that is articulated in <em>Once</em>. In <em>Saved These Words</em>, naivety is cast away, having failed again, and thus the break-up is equated with coming of age. She is no longer a little girl. At this point, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how old she is.</p>
