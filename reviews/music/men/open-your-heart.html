  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Open Your Heart - The Men : 9/10" alt="Rating - 9/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/9.gif"/>
  <p>In 2011, more than a few articles were drafted, edited and published, their authors&rsquo; armed with hindsight and sentimentality as they all looked back on 2001 with fond remembrances of the year that rock and/or popular music regained relevance.&nbsp; The Strokes&rsquo; <strong>Is This It</strong> and <strong>White Blood Cells</strong> by The White Stripes had both blown out their tenth candle and the adoration was considerable, as were the accolades: &ldquo;Saviors of Rock n&rsquo; Roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s easy to point to The White Stripes and The Strokes and declare with certainty that these bands saved rock n&rsquo; roll, I think it would be fair to say that both bands simply revived a sound that had been buried under a blanket of late <span word="90s" data-scaytid="2">90s</span> <span word="bubblegum" data-scaytid="3">bubblegum</span> pop and diluted alt-rock self-importance.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t want to discount any claim of legitimacy on either band&rsquo;s part, but as clear as their influences could gleam from their guitar strings and as legible as their music read like a bedtime story, blues rock, proto punk and garage rock were chapters already told and well-documented.&nbsp; One could say rock n&rsquo; roll in this instance had been regurgitated more than saved and this continues to be the case.</p>
<p>Every band incorporates fragments of what came before into their own thing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to avoid having references, especially if you make music, and no one expects complete originality.&nbsp; The move, though, to &ldquo;revive&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;begin anew&rdquo; continues to be debatable.&nbsp; Post 2001, <strong>White Blood Cells</strong> and <strong>Is This It</strong> bred a throng of vintage-laced <span word="detuned" data-scaytid="5">detuned</span> blues duos and <span word="lo-fi" data-scaytid="6">lo-fi</span> garage dwellers.&nbsp; How many of these bands had anything new to bring to any movement or scene?&nbsp; How many of them produced albums that weren&rsquo;t homogenized byproducts of the times that informed their sound?&nbsp; The <span word="2000s" data-scaytid="7">2000s</span> did seem an era devoted to nostalgia and while very new sounding, very interesting and exciting bands and performers emerged and attempted to make their respective marks, from a rock perspective, it&rsquo;s difficult to associate those years with anything other than the softening of indie rock and the reverb from vintage amps.&nbsp; Oh, and Coldplay.</p>
<p>When I heard the lyrics &ldquo;I like to be informed of what&rsquo;s next/I <span word="wanna" data-scaytid="4">wanna</span> know what&rsquo;s in store&rdquo; from The Men song, <em>Oscillation</em>, this observation seemed to lend itself to the attitude of the last ten years, the predictability of the mainstream to glom onto trends and kick it out with factorial indifference.&nbsp; Granted this aspect of the music industry has been a standard proven to be both beneficial and unfortunate as long as music&rsquo;s been in print, but <strong>Open Your Heart</strong>, the third album from New York rock quartet The Men, made me wonder if the mainstream will pay attention THIS time.&nbsp; And then I remembered that the industry is getting a lot of mileage out of The Black Keys right now and I snapped back to reality.</p>
<p>But, why be cynical?&nbsp; In the face of all that&rsquo;s become commonplace and forgettable, The Men&rsquo;s <strong>Open Your Heart</strong> has the good sense to utilize its influences as a means to go forward, cultivating an eclectic albeit consistent brand of independent rock n&rsquo; roll music.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it would be a stretch to say The Men were picking up where The Replacements left off, even if I am ignoring a decade&rsquo;s plus length of time between the band&rsquo;s dissolution and the aforementioned garage revivalism.&nbsp; But, I think this point is driven home with <strong>Open Your Heart </strong>as you hear country influenced, proto-based punk rock that dabbles in the <strong>Daydream Nation</strong>.&nbsp; As babyboomer hippie rock has for years fellated itself in the face of all that&rsquo;s come afterward, especially the movement of 80s independent rock and 90s alternative music, The Men&rsquo;s inventive blend of the MC5, Roky Erickson, Paul Westerberg and Sonic Youth levels the impact, putting something like <strong>Kick Out The Jams</strong> in the same league as The Replacements&rsquo; <strong>Let It Be</strong>, legitimizing rock&rsquo;s evolution in terms of its milestones and not in terms of its age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning with <em>Turn It Around</em>, an MC5 tinged rock track fueled by melodic guitar licks and high tempo, <strong>Open Your Heart </strong>maintains its energy with <em>Animal</em>, a slide guitar carving through Southern hard rock.&nbsp; Vocally indecipherable, musically rambunctious, <em>Animal</em> is followed by the near 6 minute <em>Country Song</em>, an appropriately titled instrumental piece that amusingly evokes barren tundra and tumbleweeds.&nbsp; <em>Country Song</em> bleeds into the Sonic Youth-layered introductory jam of <em>Oscillation</em>, high frequency noise riffs momentarily losing the music&rsquo;s stride around the 5-minute mark just before the band decides to add lyrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rather versatile mash of sounds that borders on the alienating, The Men follow their most avant-garde offerings with the punk-laced indie rock tracks, <em>Please Don&rsquo;t Go Away</em> and <em>Open Your Heart</em>, both of which exude the sort of loose and loud pop constructs of Dinosaur Jr. or latter-day Replacements.&nbsp; <em>Candy</em>&rsquo;s casual folk rock strum and <em>Cube</em>&rsquo;s 3 minutes of abrasive guitar sounds precede <em>Presence</em>, <strong>Open Your Heart</strong>&rsquo;s alt-country rock opus.&nbsp; At its essence, the song is one riff accompanied by notes wandering and improv&rsquo;d as the tension builds.&nbsp; Vocals harmonize, percussion ensues, its one idea flourishing as tempos change and guitar tracks interact.&nbsp; With <em>Ex-Dreams</em>, a Thurston Moore style vocal and a solid array of guitar work carry the album to its closing.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the wealth of music we as music fans or record junkies have either heard or want to hear, has rock music ever really needed to be saved?&nbsp; When people&rsquo;s ears perk up and a wave of awareness signals the dawn of some new thang, the catalyst behind these momentary lapses in the public&rsquo;s collective coma often gets treated as a cultural eureka.&nbsp; Same thing happened with Nirvana, even though a decade&rsquo;s worth of college radio was churning out the seeds of <strong>Nevermind</strong> long before it had come to be.&nbsp; And while The Men&rsquo;s <strong>Open Your Heart</strong> encapsulates a varied and fruitful amount of rock&rsquo;s best moments as well, there&rsquo;s something to be said for a band that places rock&rsquo;s elder statesmen in the same league as its pupils, realizing that, through its youth, rock has remained important.&nbsp; The old guys had it right, but the young guys did, too.&nbsp; If more bands would realize this, rock would never need to be saved.&nbsp; It would keep going and the saving would be reserved for its public.</p>
