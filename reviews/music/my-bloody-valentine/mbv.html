  <strong class="label">(self-released)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for mbv - My Bloody Valentine : 8/10" alt="Rating - 8/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/8.gif"/>
  <p>Twenty-two years can be a long time. Imagine all the things that pass in that timeframe, all the milestones and transitions that mark a person&rsquo;s life: your first day of school, your first kiss, graduating from high school, marriage. And through all this, a contemporary soundtrack usually accompanies it. We may venerate the classics as essential, but ultimately, these are the ones that we stock in a shelf. It&rsquo;s an old reliable that just sits there, waiting to remind you of how special it can be if you just give it another spin. An album like <strong>Loveless</strong> falls in a special time and place for those who were either adults or teenagers at the time; for those who weren&rsquo;t even born then, it&rsquo;s since then been branded with a critics&rsquo; seal of approval, a post-modern aural piece for those who are studious about the history of music to cherish it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine the suffering of any My Bloody Valentine devout who patiently waited all those years for a follow-up to <strong>Loveless</strong>. But it finally did. And while you let the thought that this album really exists sink in, the best to do is to enjoy it as a living document of our present, even if it occasionally sounds like one that was captured after being lost instead of one that was written for today.<strong> <span word="mbv" data-scaytid="2">mbv</span></strong>&nbsp;treads a similar ground to its predecessor, and for those who expected something different, it couldn&rsquo;t make more sense how it sounds just as uniform. <strong>Loveless</strong> still stands as one of the most bizarre essential albums in pop history &ndash; it&rsquo;s regarded highly for its advancements in production rather than its songwriting aspect, a <strong><span word="Sgt" data-scaytid="3">Sgt</span>. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</strong> if you will, but those who&rsquo;ve made a deeper connection with it understand how it operates. It&rsquo;s not meant to be a big statement about America a la <strong>Joshua Tree</strong>, or one about revealing the depth of one&rsquo;s character to the world for the first time like <strong>Like a Prayer;</strong> not every record becomes a classic in the same conventional sense. Hint: the more you read into it, the less you get out of it. The main thing it has always had going for it is that, of course, it&rsquo;s downright pretty.</p>
<p>Approaching the content of <strong><span word="mbv" data-scaytid="4">mbv</span></strong> as if were about to dissect a frog is certainly the wrong way to analyze it; as Mark Twain once wrote, &ldquo;you learn a lot in the process, but in the end you kill it&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll only end up disenchanted by it. Or perhaps it is because My Bloody Valentine begets the exercise of deliberate and intense scrutinizing. Album opener <em>She Found Now</em> is reflected like an inkblot <span word="Rorshach" data-scaytid="6">Rorshach</span> test, how it may hit different nerves in different people. The similarities to <strong>Loveless</strong> are striking, especially to <em>Sometimes</em>, how its serrated guitars occasionally come into the foreground, gently permeating with a subtle, beatific dissonance. You begin to wonder if this is an elaborate ruse orchestrated by Shields. <em>Only Tomorrow</em> is made with the same mold, except that Shields gives all its surrounding elements a bit more breathing room; without the constraints of having to follow any hit parade &ndash; in 1991 and its succeeding years, promoting the image of <span word="shoegaze" data-scaytid="7">shoegaze</span> was paramount to stand out &ndash; it&rsquo;s as if Shields fully extends the use of ambience because he knows it&rsquo;s not going to be edited in a format that will please a cable channel executive. You can sense how that fuzzed out drone flutters over the undulating bass, sharpened by a relentless, compressed chug that is pulled into a halt every so often; Shields even rips a histrionic wail on the song&rsquo;s bridge, and then loops it all the way until the song ends. Try to find one of those in <strong>Loveless</strong>. You won&rsquo;t find it, or at least it won&rsquo;t be as noticeable.</p>
<p>The middle section in&nbsp;<strong><span word="mbv" data-scaytid="8">mbv</span></strong> locks into a snugly tight haze, yet the comfort in hand could only be accredited to how My Bloody Valentine are once again playing on the turf they mastered. <em>Who Sees You</em> follows with that classic reverse reverb technique, a cycling cacophony that just meanders through a tenebrous rift.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s unsettling, yet tranquil, how the song leads you into a stupor with its soft, <span word="floaty" data-scaytid="10">floaty</span> guitars until it abruptly ends once you&rsquo;re starting to settle into the groove. <em>If I Am</em> wafts like a reverie of weightlessness, which then takes a more titillating turn with its <span word="warbly" data-scaytid="11">warbly</span>, <span word="wah-wah" data-scaytid="12">wah-wah</span> effects. Moreover, the <span word="strummy" data-scaytid="13">strummy</span>, radiant sheen of <em>New You</em> could very well be their <span word="poppiest" data-scaytid="14">poppiest</span> song on record, one that extracts all their layered, noisy <span word="accoutrements" data-scaytid="15">accoutrements</span> and augments the delicate range of <span word="Bilinda" data-scaytid="16">Bilinda</span> Butcher&rsquo;s voice. A crop of <span word="neo-shogazers" data-scaytid="17">neo-shogazers</span> have rewritten these tracks countless times, and judging by the popularity of the genre &ndash; which even boasts its own Internet <a href="http://www.decayfm.com/">radio station</a> &ndash; it makes for a fascinating point of comparison between their former and current copyists.</p>
<p>The last third of <span word="mbv" data-scaytid="18">mbv</span> is where My Bloody Valentine shed their predictability to some extent, except that the shift in tone isn&rsquo;t as surprising as it leads you to believe. <em>In Another Way</em> adds an industrial, marching beat, serving a touch of rhythm into a gliding effect that&rsquo;s almost formless, and yet it finds a way to sneak up some melodic texture into the song&rsquo;s propelling repetition. It warms you up into the rancorous lethargy of <em>Nothing Is</em>, which appends a Chuck Berry riff to its core, ingeniously injects it with steroids, and bombards you with it until your tolerance level begins to wane. Alas, this one-two punch only leads to the below par <em>Wonder 2</em> &ndash; the frantic, whirling percussion eddies with the sweeping motion of what sounds like a helicopter about to take off, giving emphasis to the glory days of drum and bass too overtly. If anything, these are the tracks that could&rsquo;ve predicted what a My Bloody Valentine album would&rsquo;ve sounded like had their contract with Island post-<strong>Loveless</strong> yielded any results.</p>
<p>It took all this time for Shields to answer that all too significant question, what would the follow-up to <strong>Loveless</strong> sound like? And one could eternally romanticize the development of <strong><span word="mbv" data-scaytid="20">mbv</span></strong> as a painstaking journey to perfection, and learning that such a record came together as a result of all the band members coming together only proves that the reasons behind the delay were, well, human. <strong><span word="mbv" data-scaytid="21">mbv</span></strong> follows its predecessor without aggrandizing its past resources, and as such, delivers a wallop of sweet, sweet distortion in a way that comes naturally to them. The days of foreshadowing the next evolution of the guitar are over, and for someone like Shields, there&rsquo;s nothing at stake for them anymore as far as expectations go. <strong>Loveless</strong>&nbsp;was like an inadvertent call to the demise of the Gulf War, the glistening of hope creeping beneath a sonic battery of harsh <span word="soundscapes" data-scaytid="24">soundscapes</span>. It pointed towards a bright future, and just like that, they disappeared without any trace. In today&#39;s age, the significance of their return holds as much significance as the rise of a company&rsquo;s stock earnings; we&rsquo;re in awe now, but once it fizzles &nbsp;in a few months we&rsquo;ll wholeheartedly anticipate the next big surprise. Shields stopped because he understood that expectations are ephemeral, and now that they&rsquo;re back, he&rsquo;s relishing the moment with his <span word="bandmates" data-scaytid="25">bandmates</span> until it&#39;s time to go back into hibernation.</p>
