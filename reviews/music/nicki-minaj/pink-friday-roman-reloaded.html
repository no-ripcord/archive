  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - Nicki Minaj : 4/10" alt="Rating - 4/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/4.gif"/>
  <p>It&rsquo;s taken a little less than two years for Nicki <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="2">Minaj</span> to go from being a hotly-tipped MC championed by Lil Wayne to becoming a genre-straddling global <span word="megastar" data-scaytid="4">megastar</span>. However, <span word="Minaj’s" data-scaytid="5">Minaj&rsquo;s</span> debut studio album and breakthrough record, <strong>Pink Friday</strong>, asked more questions than it provided answers. Does she want to be the fierce, <span word="dextrous" data-scaytid="7">dextrous</span> rapper who&rsquo;s fit to go toe-to-toe with Eminem or the lightweight, homogeneous pop star who duets with Natasha <span word="Bedingfield" data-scaytid="8">Bedingfield</span>? Does she represent a shift in power in the male-dominated world of hip-hop or has she played the female rap objectified archetype in an attempt to get to the top? And just why does she sometimes rap in an English accent?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d hope that <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong> finally dropping would provide a little clarity around these issues. However, if anything, the waters are now muddied even further. 2012 has been a bizarre year for Nicki <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="6">Minaj</span> thus far, with an album campaign that&rsquo;s been a misinformed mess. Originally due for release on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, the record didn&rsquo;t hit the shops until April. We&rsquo;ve had a record-breaking video for a song that hasn&rsquo;t even had an official release (<em>Stupid Hoe</em>) while another single (<em>Starships</em>) has been bouncing around the upper reaches of the charts for weeks while still not having a promotional video at the time of writing. In an era when release campaigns are choreographed to precision and you&rsquo;ve got an infinitely marketable star like <span word="Minaj" data-scaytid="10">Minaj</span>, such events seem like madness. That&rsquo;s not to mention giving your album of entirely new material a name that makes it sound like some Katy Perry-style bonus-tracks-hastily-added cash-in to squeeze money out of fans who deserve better.</p>
<p>If <strong>Pink Friday</strong>&rsquo;s main fault was that it tried to tick too many boxes, then <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong> repeats that mistake and then some. In fact, if we take away the two bonkers tracks that bookend the record (<em>Roman Holiday</em> and <em>Stupid Hoe</em>) then <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong> neatly breaks down into three disparate parts, which seem to be from different records entirely.</p>
<p>The first part of the record is the traditional, hip-hop side of things. Here, beats are sparse, and frills and instrumentation are minimal. It&rsquo;s all geared up to make Minaj&rsquo;s rhymes the focal point, and it gives the record something of a mixtape feel. It&rsquo;s an interesting decision to front-load the record with perhaps its least commercial tracks, but it does provide the bulk of the quality. <em>Come On A Cone</em> features oppressive synths and is underpinned by a <em>Flight Of The Bumblebee</em>-like riff. <em>I Am Your Leader</em> and <em>Beez In The Trap</em> are similarly thrilling and make good use of cameos. You really get a sense of why Minaj is so popular; there&rsquo;s something distinctive and utterly compelling about her style and flow. This is probably best displayed in the otherworldly and regal <em>Champion</em>. Her lyrics do fall into the pitfalls of hip-hop braggadocio a little too often though &ndash; many of her lines are about previous successes and haters, while one track (<em>Roman Reloaded</em>) includes sirens as well as the sounds of guns cocking and firing.</p>
<p>Once Minaj has finished with proving her gangsta credentials, she&rsquo;s out to show that she likes partying &lsquo;til dawn in a club as much as anyone else in the charts. The transition between the two styles begins with two of the record&rsquo;s worst tracks: future single <em>Right By My Side</em> and the nauseating <em>Sex In The Lounge</em>. It&rsquo;s difficult to believe any self-respecting woman would be willing to put her name to something as relentlessly misogynistic as <em>Sex In The Lounge</em>, with its crude 2010s slow jam style and highly objectionable lyrics.</p>
<p>However, if you can get past those, you&rsquo;re rewarded with one of the singles of the year so far: <em>Starships</em>. It&rsquo;s essentially a mish-mash of <em>Super Bass</em> and <em>We Found Love</em>, but none the worse for it, as it perfectly captures the hedonistic feeling the best dance music can provide. Lyrically we&rsquo;re on pretty tame ground (<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the floor, floor / I love to dance&rdquo;</em>), but as far as tracks go to forget your responsibilities and lose your inhibitions to, it&rsquo;s right on the money and has the addictive quality and irresistible hooks that 99% of these type of tracks lack. Unfortunately, Minaj follows up <em>Starships </em>with a run of four songs which all sound like inferior re-treads. We&rsquo;ve got references to Ibiza, over-produced radio-friendly backing tracks and the general feeling of a David Guetta B-sides collection.</p>
<p>By this point, Minaj&rsquo;s desperation to be liked is becoming wearing, and this is before we get onto part three of the album: the R&amp;B ballads. Though there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with Minaj&rsquo;s singing voice, it&rsquo;s not particularly distinctive and while she continues to insist upon making tracks like this, she&rsquo;ll never be anything more than a second-rate Rihanna or Beyoncé. It&rsquo;s faceless, dispiriting stuff, and we get to witness the supposed outspoken queen of forward-thinking rap grumble about fame, compare herself to Marilyn Monroe and sing about how she really just wants to be a wife, all in the space of ten minutes.</p>
<p>Before the release of <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong>, much talk centred around Minaj&rsquo;s male, British alter-ego, Roman Zolanski, and how his character would be explored throughout the LP. However, he&rsquo;s only really brought up at all on those aforementioned tracks that open and close the record. The title may lead you to believe it&rsquo;s some kind of concept album, but if that&rsquo;s its intention, that concept is quickly dropped before being picked up again right at the end as if you wouldn&rsquo;t notice that there&rsquo;s actually no common thread holding any of this together (this is a bit of a jump in logic, but it&rsquo;s the same thing that happens in <strong>Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</strong>).</p>
<p>The two Roman Zolanski-featuring tracks, <em>Roman Holiday</em> and <em>Stupid Hoe</em>, are the most inventive songs on the record, and the two that pander the least to current musical trends and expectations. The melodrama may be a little irritating, but there&rsquo;s no doubting that Minaj is a fabulous pop star who you simply can&rsquo;t ignore. Due to the rest of the album, however, <em>Roman Holiday</em> promises more than <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong> can deliver, and <em>Stupid Hoe</em> sticks out like a sore thumb after a quagmire of clichés and dullness.</p>
<p>As <em>Stupid Hoe</em> throbs to its conclusion, Minaj leaves us with five final words: <em>&ldquo;I am the female Weezy&rdquo;</em>. She&rsquo;s got a decent claim to such a title, but it&rsquo;s as if that&rsquo;s not enough. If she&rsquo;s the female Weezy, she&rsquo;s just as much the female Drake, the female Akon, the female David Guetta, the female Bruno Mars and the female Usher. Hell, with her love of over-the-top make-up and multiple personas, you could make an argument for her being the female David Bowie or the female Adam Ant too. Would you want to listen to a record that sounded like all those people? Probably not, as it sounds like a recipe for disaster which tries to please everybody and ends up being enjoyed by nobody. Unsurprisingly, that&rsquo;s exactly what <strong>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</strong> is.</p>
