  <strong class="label">(Hideout)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Lupercalia - Patrick Wolf : 6/10" alt="Rating - 6/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/6.gif"/>
  <p>For the past few years, Patrick Wolf has been looking like something of a spent force creatively. Although still gifted with an ear for a catchy hook, the stunningly/sickeningly (delete as applicable) precocious artist behind <strong>Lycanthropy</strong> and <strong>Wind in the Wires</strong> was now reduced to peddling insincere romance on <strong>The Magic Position</strong>, or, in the case of <strong>The Bachelor</strong>, burying any genuine emotion in overblown gestures (and in case the record wasn&#39;t already pretentious enough it was planned as the first part of a diptych of concept albums). So, the pre-release hype for Wolf&#39;s latest across the net, in particular from the more pop-leaning critics, was something of a surprise.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, <strong>Lupercalia</strong> certainly isn&#39;t the album that Wolf originally planned. When <strong>The Bachelor</strong> went from being a double album to a interconnected pair of single albums, the release date for part two, now entitled <strong>The Conqueror</strong>, was firmly set for 2010. But nothing arrived that year, at least not until November when Wolf released a brief announcement explaining that he had scrapped the album and <strong>Lupercalia</strong> would be its replacement. Although perhaps scrapped is putting a bit strongly as several remnants pop up on <strong>Lupercalia</strong> &ndash; the neo-renaissance ballad <em>William</em> is so similar to <strong>The Bachelor</strong>&#39;s title track that it&#39;s a likely hold-over from those sessions and <em>Time of My Life</em> and <em>Together</em> definitely were, having been previewed back when the albums were still intended to be a single release, besides it doesn&#39;t look like Wolf believes in throwing away material as <em>The Days</em> has been doing the rounds since 2007 (sadly over the four years its taken to make it onto record it&#39;s not gotten any less forgettable).</p>
<p>The reason for Wolf&#39;s volte-face on <strong>The Conqueror</strong> should become clear within the first few bars of <strong>Lupercalia</strong>. Whereas before he saw himself as a defiant young misfit, culminating in <strong>The Bachelor</strong>&#39;s statement of independence (in more ways than one as it was released on Wolf&#39;s own label, which is something else he gave up when he ditched the album as <strong>Lupercalia</strong> is being released on a Mercury subsidiary), since then he&#39;s fallen madly in love and gotten engaged and he wants the world to know all about it. So, he&#39;s placed&nbsp;<em>The City</em>, a song so goofily loved up that you just have to take your hat off to him really, as<strong> Lupercalia</strong>&#39;s opening salvo. It&#39;s hard to work out what the most ridiculous thing about the track is &ndash; could it be the &#39;top of the morning&#39; lyrical hook, the shameless sax solo, the 1980&#39;s Sunkist commercial music video, or the fact that its middle eight sounds just like Annie Lennox&#39;s <em>Walking on Broken Glass</em>? It doesn&#39;t really matter though as the song&#39;s so joyful, largely down to its fabulous horn arrangement, that it just about manages to circumvent cynicism.</p>
<p>In fact <strong>Lupercalia</strong> sees Wolf attempting to dazzle the listener with his musical ability at every turn. While &#39;big&#39; is the operative word for the album&#39;s production, unlike <strong>The Bachelor</strong> it never feels over-done, instead managing to seem light and spritely while providing every song with some delightful quirk or detail to pick up on, at the very least. To single out a few highlights, the arrangement of&nbsp;<em>The Future</em>&#39;s duetting vocals, <em>House</em> and <em>The Falcon</em>&#39;s genuinely intelligent use of a string section, and the samples and reappearance of the horns in <em>Bermondsey Street</em> particularly impress.</p>
<p>But the music is, unfortunately, only half the story. <em>Bermondsey Street</em>&#39;s lovely instrumentation gets trampled over by its artlessly blunt lyrics (however noble a sentiment the song may have) and elsewhere they don&#39;t get much better &ndash; if they aren&#39;t clumsy, they come off as smug or insincere and almost constantly self-obsessed. While it&#39;s true that Wolf is no longer writing entirely about himself, he&#39;s only really broadened his scope to include his fiancé&nbsp;&ndash; to return to <em>The City</em>, the repeated line &#39;Won&#39;t let this city destroy our love&#39; suggests that, despite letting somebody into his life, Wolf&#39;s still hanging onto his &#39;me against the world&#39; attitude, and he hasn&#39;t really grown-up much at all.</p>
<p>The sense of smugness comes not so much from every track&#39;s obsession with the brilliance of his newfound love, but from the details he chooses to express it with. For one there&#39;s the globe-trotting lyrics that flit from one country to the next in the space of a line or two &ndash; while Wind in the Wires used travel to convincingly evoke both landscapes and Wolf&#39;s thoughts, here it just sounds like somebody casually dropping the places he went on his gap year into a conversation.&nbsp;More problematic, however, are Wolf&#39;s stabs at squalor and melancholy. He&#39;s always come off as possessing an incredible amount of self belief (of course this may well be a pre-requisite for any aspiring pop star), but the likes of <em>William</em>, <em>The Days</em>, and <em>Slow Motion</em> are delivered with such confidence that it all starts to feel a bit musical theatre &ndash; with the ugly details merely worn as fauxhemian trappings to bestow the proceedings with some sort of unearned drama.</p>
<p><em>Time of My Life</em> (one of the aforementioned Conqueror hold-overs) however, is something of an exception, not only does it drop a tale of out-and-out heartbreak into all the romance, but it also sees Wolf put his self-confidence to good use, as instead of attempting to wallow in despair he unleashes his inner-diva and essentially rewrites <em>I will Survive</em> for men. It may be the best thing he&#39;s ever recorded (and it&#39;s also nicely complemented, musically, by the Giorgio Moroder stylings of <em>Together</em>).</p>
<p>With the lupine album titles, it may well be the case that Wolf intends <strong>Lupercalia</strong> to be the end of the story he started with <strong>Lycanthropy</strong>, covering his life from the (self-styled) urchin on his first album cover to becoming the big bright shining star that he always dreamed of being. And if this is the case, <strong>Lupercalia</strong>, despite its flaws, does provide a satisfying sense of closure. Now, hopefully, Patrick Wolf will be able to graduate onto subjects other than himself (and an attempt to do a full-on disco record would not go amiss either).</p>
