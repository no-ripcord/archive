  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Too Bright - Perfume Genius : 8/10" alt="Rating - 8/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/8.gif"/>
  <p>Some might say that art&rsquo;s greatest, most therapeutic (and some might say only real) use is as a means of self-expression. For most, this means one simple thing &ndash; taking all of the hardships, worries, and insecurities in your life that make you feel small and helpless and spinning it all into something creative as a means to translate to others how you feel, and for many, art might be the only way they can do it. Listening to the work of Perfume Genius, a.k.a. singer-songwriter Michael <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="1">Hadreas</span>, you&rsquo;d get the impression he&rsquo;s one of these people. With his debut album&nbsp;<strong>Learning,</strong> and excellent follow-up <strong>Put Your Back N 2 It</strong>, <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="4">Hadreas</span> let all of his blood out with sparsely arranged, deeply personal music that took all of the singer&rsquo;s greatest demons &ndash; from his family history, to his health struggles, to the hardships he&rsquo;s faced as an openly gay male &ndash; and spun them into poetic-yet-revealing songs delivered with the singers wounded, quivering wail. Each song felt &ndash; lyrically and sonically &ndash; like the work of someone completely crushed by the woes in their life, with art being the only way they can make any sense of it.</p>
<p>But what if expressing yourself through art can do more for you than just give you a place to vent and relate your problems with us. What if through writing a song, art can instead transform you &ndash; let you become something more powerful, fearful, and intimidating than the things that intimidate and overpower you. What if music can turn you into a fierce predator and make your demons your prey. This is the type of expression <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="6">Hadreas</span> boldly goes for in <strong>Too Bright</strong>, the songwriter&rsquo;s latest and easily most confident album, which features a wider musical palate and lyrics which, while still damaged and confessional, attempt to place the singer above his problems rather than submerged deep within them.</p>
<p>The album&rsquo;s opening breath &ndash; the sparse piano ballad <em>I Decline</em> &ndash; could admittedly fit neatly with the many sparse piano ballads that have made up much of <span word="Hadreas’" data-scaytid="11">Hadreas&rsquo;</span> output, but rather than a retread of the artists past work, the song instead works to ease in listeners while explicitly laying out <strong>Too Bright&rsquo;s</strong> newfound point-of-view. &ldquo;<em>I can see for miles/The same old line/No thanks/I decline</em>,&rdquo; croons <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="17">Hadreas</span> on each plink of the piano. Consider this verse <span word="Hadreas’" data-scaytid="23">Hadreas&rsquo;</span> thesis for the album &ndash; the problems that have haunted him in the past and present are still <span word="omni-present" data-scaytid="29">omni-present</span>, but rather than completely giving in to them, he chooses to stand defiant in spite of them, looking away simply because he chooses to.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not convinced, the following track, the outrageous <em>Queen</em>, will do the trick. With its bombastic drums, distortion-layered vocals, and <span word="glammed-out" data-scaytid="30">glammed-out</span> <span word="synths" data-scaytid="34">synths</span> which range from oppressive to sparkling, <em>Queen</em> not only completely dismantles everything you&rsquo;ve ever thought about <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="32">Hadreas</span> as a musician, but as a subject in his own music as well. &ldquo;<em>No family&rsquo;s safe when I sashay</em>,&rdquo; he shouts before grunting like a pumped, bloodthirsty football player. This isn&rsquo;t the sound of singer scared and overwhelmed, this is the confident voice of a man completely owning his sexual identity and using it to release the beast inside of him, causing all that gets in his way to tremble.</p>
<p><span word="Hadreas’" data-scaytid="37">Hadreas&rsquo;</span> lyricism has always been the shining element of Perfume Genius, but while it is still as strong as ever, it&rsquo;s the audacious sonic qualities that really stand out on <strong>Too Bright</strong>, and will certainly turn the most heads of fans and new listeners alike. The addition of more abrasive and defined <span word="synth" data-scaytid="39">synth</span> textures tend to be the key ingredient in livening things up, but they&rsquo;re hardly used in a one-dimensional sense. <em><span word="Longpig" data-scaytid="42">Longpig</span></em>, for instance, is built on idiosyncratic, <span word="sci-fi-like" data-scaytid="44">sci-fi-like</span> <span word="synths" data-scaytid="43">synths</span> reminiscent of <span word="Kraftwerk" data-scaytid="46">Kraftwerk</span>, while more aggressive tracks, like the ear-splitting <em>My Body</em> or the Suicide-inspired standout <em>Grid</em>, go for a pervasive industrial vibe. Even aside from the <span word="synths" data-scaytid="47">synths</span>, however, many of these songs are embellished with urgent rhythm sections and eccentric backing vocals (especially on <em>Grid</em>), to further rewrite what we thought we knew about Perfume Genius.</p>
<p>But even when <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="51">Hadreas</span> isn&rsquo;t trying to throw us off with aggressive industrial bursts and switches back to the faithful piano settings on his keyboard, the songwriter&rsquo;s obvious compositional growth carries songs to levels they&rsquo;ve never been before. <em>No Good</em>, for instance, carries on for its first two minutes like a standard Perfume Genius song until <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="53">Hadreas</span> allows the song to be whisked away on an <span word="elegent" data-scaytid="57">elegent</span>, almost impressionistic piano line while disembodied vocals layer on atmosphere, and with <em>Fool</em>, we see the singer totally distancing himself from a traditional song structure, allowing the track to morph multiple times in less than 4 minutes. What really stands out, however, is the euphoric transition between the incredibly atmospheric <em>I&rsquo;m a Mother</em>, who&rsquo;s organs and vocals are so low register you&rsquo;d question whether they&rsquo;re even there, before slowing building into a quiet splendor as it passes on to <em>Too Bright</em>. This shows how <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="58">Hadreas</span> has been considering the composition of songs not just within tracks, but between them as well, suggesting a greater connectivity between the tracks not seen as much on past releases.</p>
<p>Through <strong>Too Bright</strong>, it&rsquo;s clear that <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="14">Hadreas</span> is still as wounded as he&rsquo;s ever been. The album&rsquo;s closer, <em>All Along,</em> seems to attempt to settle the score on this, as it&rsquo;s one of the more plainly spoken tracks on the album. While the song is still brimming with the confidence displayed throughout the album (<em>&ldquo;You wasted my time&rdquo;</em>), what stands out to me are the last few lines &ndash; <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your love/I don&rsquo;t need you to understand/I need you to listen.&rdquo;</em> In a sense, <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="15">Hadreas</span> perfectly captures what an artist might want to get out of putting their feelings on a record in the first place &ndash; listeners can&rsquo;t be there for you or pat you on the back, they simply listen, and sometimes that&rsquo;s therapy in itself. Few artists in this day and age take self-expression through art to heart like <span word="Hadreas" data-scaytid="16">Hadreas</span> does as Perfume Genius, and with the sensitive confidence that radiates from <strong>Too Bright</strong>, he&rsquo;s mastered it in a way few artists never do.</p>
