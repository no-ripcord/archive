  <strong class="label">(Konichiwa Records)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Body Talk Pt. 2 - Robyn : 6/10" alt="Rating - 6/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/6.gif"/>
  <p>Let me start off by saying that I fell head over heels for Robyn in March of this year, when I purchased 2005&rsquo;s <strong><em>Robyn</em></strong> on a whim after hearing the that she was going to release three(!) full length albums in 2010.&nbsp; Anyone who knows Robyn&rsquo;s work can understand the sentiment: She&rsquo;s simply <em>everything</em>.&nbsp; Her 2005 album featured a mélange of musical styles, ranging from club-ready hip-hop, propulsive electro-pop, and even a bit of bubble gum (the latter most likely being related to her previous 90s incarnation as a R&amp;B-inflected songstress).&nbsp; Other tracks such as <em>Any Time You Like</em> and <em>Should Have Known</em> featured a sexual weirdness (in both musical arrangements and vocal stylings) suggestive of a long standing obsession with <strong><em>Sign of the Times</em></strong>.&nbsp; Lyrically too, Robyn depicted a dual personality that embodied either an invincible hip-hop superhero, or a bitter, dejected lover. It&rsquo;s this dual identity of both braggart and sad sack that made <strong><em>Robyn</em></strong> such an entertaining record: Though certainly not a flawless record, there were considerably more hits than misses and it featured lots of compelling music, clever wordplay, and several novelty tracks that actually achieved their intended comedic effect.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re at the second <strong><em>Body Talk</em></strong> installment, which on the whole, fares a little better than <strong><em>Pt</em>. <em>1</em></strong>.&nbsp; This statement requires some elaboration in the sense that some of the substantial acclaim heaped upon <strong><em>Pt</em>. <em>1</em></strong> seemed both overstated and (slightly) undeserved.&nbsp; Comprised of a scant eight tracks, only four (the album&rsquo;s first half) were what you could consider &ldquo;actual&rdquo; Robyn material, three of which were excellent.&nbsp; The album&rsquo;s second half was marred by a pair of dancehall-wannabe duds, and a couple piano ballads, one of which was a Swedish folk song she sang in her native tongue (sorry Robyn, I&rsquo;m all for valuing cultural heritage, but we&rsquo;re listening because we&rsquo;re interested in <em>you</em>, and your performing a song in a foreign language discourages large-scale identification with your work), and another that appears in its full form on <strong><em>Pt</em> .<em>2</em></strong> (<em>Hang With Me</em>).&nbsp; To more succinctly sum up the album, given the especially high caliber of her previous work, Robyn got too much praise for doing too little of what makes her so special.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some would counter that the <strong><em>Body Talk</em></strong> series shouldn&rsquo;t be evaluated in terms of the quality of each volume as an <em>album</em> per se, but instead as a new-media P.R. campaign: Robyn&rsquo;s an artist who&rsquo;s been out of the game for half a decade, and putting out three (albeit abbreviated) albums in the course of a year also represents a way to make up for lost time, promote her image, and make a display of artistic pragmatism concerning the full length LP as a relevant format for music.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fine with all of these arguments; I&rsquo;m just saying that if an artist is going for this approach of releasing more concise records over a shorter period of time, the music ought to be more uniformly consistent than <strong><em>Body Talk Pt. 1</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it&rsquo;s a little harder to level this critique at <strong><em>Pt. 2</em></strong>, which features less filler, and more tracks that are straight-up Robyn.&nbsp; Album opener <em>In My Eyes</em> entails some respectable space-minded dance pop, with Robyn lyrically describing herself as a source of vague, cosmic redemption for world weary listeners.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a decent enough song, but it&rsquo;s one of numerous tracks in her career where attempts at describing commonplace emotional calamity come off as either trite (<em>Cry When You Get Older</em>) or downright silly (<em>Robotboy</em>).&nbsp; Another prime example of this deficiency occurs on <strong><em>Pt. 2</em></strong>&rsquo;s <em>Love Kills</em>, where blaster cannon arpeggiators and drum machines provide the backdrop for dreadful lines such as, &ldquo;Protect yourself/Cuz you&rsquo;ll wreck yourself/In this cold hard world/So check yourself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Robyn is more successful when she keeps the lyrical spotlight on herself.&nbsp; The dance version of <em>Hang With Me</em> is an endearing portrait of personal vulnerability, and the new arrangement, complete with Robyn&rsquo;s trademark of layered vocal parts, commands much more respect than its previous iteration on <strong><em>Body Talk Pt. 1</em></strong>.&nbsp; Though there are elements of silliness to each, <em>Criminal Intent</em> and <em>U Should Know Better</em> (with the latter featuring vocal contributions from Snoop Dogg) mark a satisfying return to Robyn&rsquo;s self-directed superlatives for her sexual appetite and general bad-assery.&nbsp; Alongside the verses of <em>Include Me Out</em> (which features a delightfully explosive kick drum sound), these tracks make <strong><em>Body Talk Pt. 2</em></strong> a fairly urban-minded record.</p>
<p><em>We Dance to the Beat</em>, which is one part techno, one part futurist sound collage, embodies the album&rsquo;s most unexpected number.&nbsp; Now, tweaked beats and heavily processed vocals by no means represent a new musical development (Daft Punk, LCD Soundsystem, even Radiohead, blah blah blah), but the song is a refreshing change of pace for an artist like Robyn who&rsquo;s usually so pop-minded.</p>
<p>In closing, the most important remaining question concerns Robyn&rsquo;s stylistic direction following completion of the <strong><em>Body Talk</em></strong> project.&nbsp; The contents of <em>Pts. </em>1 &amp; 2 allow for some pretty safe estimations concerning what&rsquo;s in store on <strong><em>Pt</em>. <em>3</em></strong>: Misplaced album closer <em>Indestructible</em> will get a makeover comparable to <em>Hang With Me</em>, in addition to there being some songs about fictitious heroism, and some about vicious heartache, all of which will be mostly above average pop.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s after that album that she has some strategizing to do.&nbsp; With regards to Robyn&rsquo;s assumed artistic persona, the cultural aphorism &ldquo;Familiarity breeds contempt&rdquo; sums up her work rather well.&nbsp; As stated, at first listen, Robyn <em>was</em> everything I wanted.&nbsp; However, three albums whose songs that routinely alternate between a top-of-the-world mindset for a more melancholic perspective inevitably suggest some frustrating inconsistencies in Robyn&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great when artists learn to produce work that has more than one dimension to it.&nbsp; Robyn&rsquo;s has two.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d just like to see her develop one or two more.&nbsp;</p>
