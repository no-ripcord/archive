  <strong class="label">(4AD)</strong>
  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Bish Bosch - Scott Walker : 8/10" alt="Rating - 8/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/8.gif"/>
  <p>Scott Walker is the man who went from performing richly baroque pop to creating records based around samples of pig carcass-boxing, there&rsquo;s nothing he could do to surprise or shock us anymore&hellip; Or perhaps not, as not only does <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="1">Bish</span> Bosch</strong> come a mere six years after his last album proper, <strong>The Drift</strong>, a relatively short gap by his recent standards (made even shorter if 2007&rsquo;s contemporary dance score <strong>And Who Shall Go To The Ball? And What Shall Go To The Ball?</strong> is also considered), but the name perhaps suggests that the album might be an unusually light-hearted romp; an ode to the Jamie Oliver &lsquo;chuck everything into the pan, <span word="bish" data-scaytid="2">bish</span> bash <span word="bosh’" data-scaytid="3">bosh&rsquo;</span> school of cookery perhaps?*</p>
<p>No need to worry though as it turns out there&rsquo;s a more serious, artistically credible reasoning behind that title, hinting at street slang and <span word="Hieronymus" data-scaytid="4">Hieronymus</span> Bosch, and despite the odd burst of <span word="humour" data-scaytid="5">humour</span> &ndash; the fart noises of <em>Corps De Blah</em> are particularly unexpected, and not entirely welcome - the album&rsquo;s contents are as dark and generally inscrutable as you&rsquo;d come to expect from following Walker&rsquo;s recent career. The instrumentation might seem relatively sensible &ndash; the closest you&rsquo;ll find to butchery here is the incessant menacing scrape of machetes in <em>Tar</em> &ndash; but Walker&rsquo;s tenor in a wind-tunnel croon is still the loneliest sound imaginable, and the lyrics are just as obtuse yet death and decay-driven as ever. As with the work of any artist of advanced years (Walker&rsquo;s currently 69, although the consensus seems to be that he neither looks nor acts it), it&rsquo;s tempting to claim that the work is a meditation on mortality, despite the fact that the album&rsquo;s accompanying notes stress the importance of not treating the work as autobiographical.</p>
<p>And yet, such facile conclusions are practically necessary in order to initially navigate the record&rsquo;s 73 oddball minutes, such is the slipperiness of its contents. Attempting to work through the lyrics, which in print look more like poetry or <span word="Beckett-esque" data-scaytid="6">Beckett-esque</span> minimalist drama, often feels like deciphering code, and can be something of a maddening experience &ndash; album <span word="centrepiece" data-scaytid="7">centrepiece</span> (if only due to its 21 minute running time) <em><span word="SDSS1416" data-scaytid="8">SDSS1416</span>+<span word="13B" data-scaytid="9">13B</span> (<span word="Zercon" data-scaytid="10">Zercon</span>, A Flagpole Sitter)</em>&rsquo;s central comic juxtaposition would be completely ungraspable if footnotes hadn&rsquo;t been included in the lyric book, and, to be honest, the idea doesn&rsquo;t seem that funny even when you know what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that a fair amount of <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="11">Bish</span> Bosch</strong> is outright nonsense, and that given Walker&rsquo;s reputation, there is an urge to seek wisdom that may not actually be there, and while it can be difficult to admit defeat in interpreting such a work, it ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter as pleasure can, and indeed is meant to, be found in the fragments. In fact that in itself might be the point; Walker grew tired with conventional easy beauty a long time ago and has been attempting to deconstruct it ever since. Hence the album&rsquo;s frequently marrying lush Hollywood strings with abruptly lurching song structures, or incongruous lyrics and music. Opener <em>&ldquo;See You Don&rsquo;t Bump His Head&rdquo;</em> takes a moment of mourning from the screenplay of <strong>From Here To Eternity</strong> and renders it a pounding electronic nightmare (abrasive as it is, it&rsquo;s probably the album&rsquo;s strongest point, thanks to its tight focus); <em>Phrasing</em> has him recite the line &lsquo;pain is not alone&rsquo; over and over while his backing musicians slip from stadium rock drum solos to full-out samba; while sections of <span word="…Zercon" data-scaytid="13">&hellip;<em>Zercon</em></span>&hellip; might have been written specifically for the very small minority who felt that what <span word="Penderecki’s" data-scaytid="15">Penderecki&rsquo;s</span> <em>Threnody To The Victims Of Hiroshima</em> was missing was a load of catty insults (although Walker does have a flair for a witty put-down &ndash; &lsquo;If shit were music you&rsquo;d be a brass band&rsquo; is almost as good as anything Death Grips came up with in <em>Hacker</em>, this year&rsquo;s high watermark of cryptic musical <span word="dissing" data-scaytid="17">dissing</span>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of which, again, isn&rsquo;t something that someone who had been following Walker&rsquo;s career wouldn&rsquo;t expect, but <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="16">Bish</span> Bosch</strong> is a wilder, more scattered (and <span word="scatty" data-scaytid="19">scatty</span>, in the case of <em><span word="Epizootics" data-scaytid="20">Epizootics</span>!</em>, ten minutes of sax-driven jazz which could almost be seen as accessible, if it wasn&rsquo;t so dark and threatening) work than its immediate predecessors, featuring neither the extraordinary beauty of <strong>Tilt</strong>, nor the cold <span word="rigour" data-scaytid="22">rigour</span> of <strong>The Drift</strong>; an album that although perhaps more difficult, was more easily comprehensible. Much of <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="21">Bish</span> Bosch</strong>&#39;s lyrical content and themes seems to be suggested by connections and ideas so idiosyncratic that they can be a bit hard to swallow. But then, such is the danger of discussing the work of a mind that works in a genuinely unique way (not to bring up the rather overused term genius, but....)</p>
<p>Harder to dismiss are the concerns that, for all Walker&rsquo;s madcap invention, there&rsquo;s too much familiarity in <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="24">Bish</span> Bosch</strong>&rsquo;s contents, both in the sense that its tracks can on occasion seem a little interchangeable (which to be fair is hardly surprising considering their length and segmented structures) and that they reflect what&rsquo;s come before &ndash; not just the contents of Walker&#39;s own back <span word="catalogue" data-scaytid="26">catalogue</span>, but the work of others &ndash; <em>Dimple</em> is a dead ringer for Throbbing Gristle&rsquo;s <em>Hamburger Lady</em>, although the decision to convey much of its isolated drama in Danish makes it a thankfully easier listen, if at first a borderline silly one.</p>
<p>Not for any moment should it be considered that <strong><span word="Bish" data-scaytid="27">Bish</span> Bosch</strong> is a conservative work, by general standards it&rsquo;s still way out there, it&rsquo;s just that it could be said that, by evoking past works, even unintentionally (the <span word="reappropriation" data-scaytid="29">reappropriation</span> of <em>Jingle Bells</em> as a funeral march in <em>The Day The <span word="Conducator" data-scaytid="30">Conducator</span> Died</em>, inspired by &ndash; but not a direct account of - <span word="Ceausescu’s" data-scaytid="31">Ceausescu&rsquo;s</span> Christmas day execution, is a different matter, and disproves the assumption that sticking sleigh bells on a song will instantly make it festive) is rather going against the spirit of the <span word="‘avant-garde’" data-scaytid="32">&lsquo;avant-garde&rsquo;</span> and suggests that Walker may now need to consider a new approach. Although with he himself mentioning that he sees the work as a final part of a trilogy, perhaps this is a case of admitting that he&rsquo;s gone as far as he can in deconstruction. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll soon get to hear whatever it is that he decides to rebuild from the wreckage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Actually, with the closest thing to cooking instruction in the lyrics being <em>Pilgrim</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Blowing up bullfrogs with a straw&rsquo; it might be fairer to say that his celebrity chef of choice is Heston <span word="Blumenthal" data-scaytid="33">Blumenthal</span>.<br />&nbsp;</p>
