  <p>If I could travel back in time to meet the sixteen year old version of myself, I can guarantee that the mumbling, acne-scarred teenager would try to strike up a conversation about The Stone Roses. He would, of course, be utterly convinced of their unquestionable greatness. He would try to persuade me that <b><i>Second Coming</i></b> is a <i>great</i> record; he&rsquo;d enthusiastically demonstrate that he could play the guitar parts to <i>Waterfall</i> and <i>Sally Cinnamon</i> (but not <i>I Am The Resurrection</i>, obviously) in their entirety. If I popped by on a really quiet day he might even try to play one of his numerous Roses bootlegs &ndash; Spike Island, Manchester International &rsquo;87, Leicester &rsquo;95, etc. My skincare and fashion advice &ndash; top tips: ditch the faux-Pollocked <i>Made in Stone</i> t-shirt and stop wearing tracksuit bottoms for Christ&rsquo;s sake &ndash; would doubtlessly fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>The next five years would be a rude awakening for this bright-eyed Roses loving kid. In his first year at university he suffered the gross misfortune of seeing Reni&rsquo;s truly awful (but mercifully short-lived) post-Roses project The Rub live. A disappointing Ian Brown solo show seemed par for the course &ndash; the guy never could hold a tune &ndash; but the watershed moment was undoubtedly John Squire&rsquo;s 2003 solo show at Sheffield Leadmill. The sound of some choice Roses favourites being mutilated by their own co-creator was too much to bear; Squire took bad singing to depths that even Ian Brown circa Reading &rsquo;96 could never imagine possible.</p>
<p>Prior to sitting down to review this album I was surprised to learn that I had voluntarily listened to a mere <i>nine</i> Stone Roses songs since June 2007 (thanks for the inane stat, last.fm). I&rsquo;ve obviously heard a few more in bars and clubs, but for my old favourite band this represented a significant fall from grace. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m still pretty certain that I&rsquo;ve listened to <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> more than any other album ever recorded &ndash; I packed a lot of listening into those formative years &ndash; and the process of reacquainting myself with a forgotten favourite is slightly peculiar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been particularly interested in re-mastered albums &ndash; I like my 180 gram vinyl as much as the next man, but the songs have always been the main attraction for me &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve already heard 98% of the Roses catalogue (released and unreleased), so I&rsquo;m not too bothered about the bonus materials included with the Legacy and Collector&rsquo;s Editions of this release either. For me, the crucial questions are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Is <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> the stone-cold classic album that I used to swear it was?</p>
<p>2. Twenty years on from its initial release, has <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> stood the test of time?</p>
<p>The short answers are (1) not quite, but nearly and (2) just about. Read on for the rambling essay-style answers...</p>
<p>In my youthful naivety I pretty much bought the idea that The Stone Roses had toiled in obscurity, working on their formula for pop perfection, which was unleashed on a public who had been starved of great British music throughout the Eighties. This is pretty much the synopsis of John Robb&rsquo;s hagiography, <i>The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop</i>. I can now appreciate that there was a wealth of great music released in Britain in the Eighties &ndash; I&rsquo;m thinking of bands like the Smiths, New Order, Orange Juice, The Cure, The Fall, The Comsat Angels, the list goes on and on &ndash; and that most of the music that followed in the wake of the Roses&rsquo; success was a lot less interesting. In other words, there was no &lsquo;resurrection&rsquo;. A few years after the release of <b><i>TSR</i></b>, in fact, the very worst Britpop bands were the ones that tried to ape the swagger of Brown and the miniature guitar heroics of Squire; the best British bands of the early-to-mid nineties &ndash; Pulp, The Auteurs, Blur*, even the embryonic Radiohead &ndash; had really very little to do with the legacy of the Roses.</p>
<p><i>* Blur&rsquo;s No Other Way is an embarrassing &lsquo;Madchester&rsquo; rip-off. The </i><i>Colchester</i><i> band improved when they stopped trying to be Northerners and embraced classic British songwriting and </i><i>US</i><i> indie-rock guitars.</i></p>
<p>The Roses are often affiliated with acid-house and cited as one of the first bands to fuse rock music with the late Eighties dance music scene. Drummer Alan &lsquo;Reni&rsquo; Wren&rsquo;s inventive, off-beat rhythms were probably the most overtly &lsquo;dance&rsquo; element in the band&rsquo;s sound, but aside from classic 1990 single <i>Fool&rsquo;s Gold</i>, which was uncomfortably tacked on to the US release of this album, and <b><i>Second Coming</i></b>&rsquo;s <i>Begging You</i>, The Roses never really hinted at any <i>major</i> interest in dance music. Primal Scream&rsquo;s <b><i>Screamadelica</i></b> may have been opportunistic and The Happy Mondays were clearly drug-addled train-wrecks, but at the turn of the decade they were much more representative of the dance/rock crossover scene than The Roses. Fellow Manchester band New Order had, of course, been successfully bridging the divide for years.</p>
<p>Essentially what I&rsquo;m getting at here is that <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> was an important album to me and countless other listeners, but that its importance in the canon of British popular music is largely overstated. I&rsquo;m not saying it hasn&rsquo;t been an influential record, but I can&rsquo;t really think of any bands that have used the Roses template to create a truly brilliant album. At the other end of the spectrum, however, there&rsquo;s an army of nauseating Ian Brown wannabes and dire Brit-rock acts who would scoff at any suggestion that <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> isn&rsquo;t the best British album ever. Sadly, when I think of The Stone Roses&rsquo; legacy, it&rsquo;s these idiots that spring to mind.</p>
<p>Listening to <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> today, I&rsquo;m struck by how fresh it sounds. <i>I Wanna Be Adored</i> immediately transports me back to my teens. This was the first Roses track I heard, having bought the album based on a recommendation. It feels longer than I remember, but it&rsquo;s still a cracking opener and a cheeky manifesto. <i>She Bangs the Drums</i> is a great pop song, but it&rsquo;s almost too familiar to my ears now &ndash; a victim of overexposure &ndash; and I quickly move on to one of my all-time favourite Roses tunes. Amazingly, <i>Waterfall</i>&rsquo;s chiming riff still sends chills down my spine; it&rsquo;s so good, in fact, that the band used it twice, turning over the tape and sticking on a few overdubs to create the album&rsquo;s most psychedelic moment, <i>Don&rsquo;t Stop</i>. This was the first track I began to skip in my late teens; perhaps the first acknowledgement that <b><i>TSR</i></b> wasn&rsquo;t entirely perfect. Incidentally, there are handful of other &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; tracks offered with the deluxe editions of this release. One is almost certainly enough.</p>
<p><i>Bye Bye Badman</i> and the embarrassing <i>Elizabeth My Dear</i> are the tracks that I already find myself skipping in 2009. Maybe I never really <i>loved</i> these songs and was too afraid to admit it to myself? It&rsquo;s a possibility; my appreciation for the Roses bordered on the delusional for a time. <i>Badman</i> is about the Parisian student riots of 1968 &ndash; nice theme, lightweight song &ndash; and <i>Elizabeth</i> is an anti-Royalist ditty set to the tune of <i>Scarborough Fair</i> that stands up to repeated listening only slightly better than <b><i>OK Computer</i></b>&rsquo;s <i>Fitter Happier</i>. There&rsquo;s even a muffled gunshot at the end. Edgy stuff.</p>
<p>I had expected <i>Sugar Spun Sister</i> to sound dated, too, but I couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong. Brown&rsquo;s voice almost sounds angelic and the major key jangle provides a lovely contrast to the moodier <i>Made in Stone</i>, which ushers in a finale that strives for perfection and very nearly achieves it. <i>Shoot You Down</i> is a shuffling slow-burner, which demonstrates the genius of the Roses&rsquo; rhythm section while <i>This Is The One</i> is one of the album&rsquo;s unsung classics; the moment when Reni shifts the track into second gear with a subtle fill at 1:48 gets me every time.</p>
<p>The final track is an eight minute glimpse of pop music heaven. Reni&rsquo;s simple yet insistent beat, Mani&rsquo;s lively bass work, and Squire&rsquo;s faultless guitar shapes provide a canvas for Brown to make his boldest claim of all: <i>I Am The Resurrection</i>. Squire even manages to keep a lid on his Jimmy Page fetish during the extended jam at the end. To call it a guitar solo would be unfair; Mani and Reni are just as instrumental in the success of this passage of music, which is arguably the pinnacle of The Stone Roses&rsquo; career.</p>
<p>Success, drugs, and the egos of various members ripped the soul out of The Stone Roses in the early nineties, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that either side of this album the band released some great music. From 1987 to 1991, <i>Sally Cinnamon</i>, <i>Going Down</i>, <i>Elephant Stone</i>, <i>Going Down</i>, <i>Mersey Paradise</i>, <i>Standing Here</i>, <i>Fool&rsquo;s Gold</i>, <i>What The World Is Waiting For</i> and <i>One Love </i>all come highly recommended. Even <b><i>Second Coming</i></b> boasts a handful of strong tunes (<i>Begging You</i>, <i>Love Spreads</i>, <i>Ten Storey Love Song</i>).</p>
<p>Aside from making a lot of us feel ever so slightly old, the twentieth anniversary of <b><i>The Stone Roses</i></b> provides an opportunity to approach a great British band in a new light. Ditch those rose-tinted aviators and learn to love <b><i>TSR</i></b> as the great album it is. Just don&rsquo;t call it the <i>greatest</i>.</p>
