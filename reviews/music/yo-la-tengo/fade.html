  <img class="rating-image" title="Rating for Fade - Yo La Tengo : 8/10" alt="Rating - 8/10" src="../../../sites/default/themes/noripcord/images/rating/8.gif"/>
  <p><span word="Yo" data-scaytid="4">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="8">Tengo</span> has never been an easily predictable band, and that&rsquo;s saying quite a bit for a band closing in on 30 years of activity. While most new releases by such multigenerational artists are usually left as after-thoughts in the minds of most music fans (comments such as &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think they still made music&rdquo; are often thrown around with only mild enthusiasm), <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="5">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="9">Tengo</span> has been an interesting exception to this rule, as they consistently garner attention from both new and old fans every 3-4 years without any reunions or &ldquo;comeback album&rdquo; hype to back them. This is largely due to their ability to keep people guessing with their eclectic taste for songwriting, as albums ranging from the classic <strong>I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One</strong> to their most recent, 2009&rsquo;s <strong>Popular Songs</strong>, could abruptly change styles at the drop of a hat, with harrowing, feedback-drenched sprawls sitting not too far from a Beach Boys cover.</p>
<p>Despite their penchant for variety, however, <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="10">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="11">Tengo</span> is nevertheless a band built on consistency: They&rsquo;ve basically had the same line-up since the early nineties, and members Ira Kaplan and Georgia <span word="Hubley" data-scaytid="14">Hubley</span> are pretty much the last great indie rock power couple since Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon&rsquo;s relationship tragically bit the dust. Not to mention, some of the bands greatest albums, like 1993&rsquo;s <span word="shoegaze-y" data-scaytid="15">shoegaze-y</span> opus <strong>Painful</strong> and 2000&rsquo;s midnight blue masterpiece <strong>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out</strong>, also happen to be some of the bands most concise releases, and have helped establish what would be considered the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="16">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="17">Tengo</span> sound.</p>
<p>This is mainly the realm in which <strong>Fade</strong> falls in, as the band&rsquo;s latest release for Matador feels more indebted to this &ldquo;classic&rdquo; sound than any of their releases from the past decade. There&rsquo;s an air of familiarity to the group&rsquo;s latest, with many of the album&#39;s tracks falling within the atmospheric, gentle indie rock spectrum they&rsquo;ve become known for, and it feels as though <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="20">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="22">Tengo</span> have grown content with just being <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="21">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="23">Tengo</span>. They even remember to include the obligatory fuzzed-out rocker in <em>Paddle Foreword</em>, this album&rsquo;s <em><span word="Sugarcube" data-scaytid="33">Sugarcube</span></em>, just to further balance out the equation. Normally, this is where we&rsquo;d close the book on <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="28">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="29">Tengo</span>, as this must mean that they&rsquo;ve just run out of interesting things to say, and hey, it&rsquo;s been a good run for 30 years anyway, right?</p>
<p>But &ldquo;playing it safe&rdquo; would hardly be accurate in describing&nbsp;<span word="Yo" data-scaytid="32">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo’s" data-scaytid="37">Tengo&rsquo;s</span> approach on <strong>Fade</strong>, as the exhilarating and entrancing <em>Ohm</em>, the album&#39;s opening track, presents a different motive from the group. &nbsp;Complete with a <span word="trippy" data-scaytid="42">trippy</span>, droning riff, lyrics that reflect on the passage of time, and Ira Kaplan&rsquo;s loose, fiery guitar static, <em>Ohm</em> is as adventurous, hypnotic, and as inviting as any of the band&#39;s best material, and proof that they can sound completely fresh while still exercising familiarity. But it should be noted that <em>Ohm</em>, which clocks in at just under seven minutes, is the longest track found amongst <strong>Fade&rsquo;s</strong> ten tracks. This may not seem incredibly significant at first, but when compared to their last album, where three out of twelve tracks sat around the ten minute mark or more, it reveals a significant effort by the group to trim the fat, eschewing lengthy jams and drones for what might be the band&#39;s most fully focused, cohesive, and &ldquo;song-oriented&rdquo; effort yet.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;cohesive&rdquo; might not be the first thing that comes to mind upon listening to <strong>Fade</strong> for the first time, as the album&#39;s ten tracks, as relatively simple and even standard as they are for <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="38">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="40">Tengo</span>, exist in dense, foggy ecosystems as vibrant and full of life as the breathtaking tree on the album cover. Through even the simplest of tracks, <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="39">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="41">Tengo</span> maintain an aural glow from beginning to end, with tracks like <em>Stupid Things</em> and the <span word="folky" data-scaytid="57">folky</span> <em>I&rsquo;ll Be Around</em> exuding a somber and sincere type of romance and elegance that converge seamlessly. The album&#39;s stellar production is certainly a contributing factor, as producer John <span word="McEntire" data-scaytid="58">McEntire</span>, who proves to be an excellent fit for the group, breathes life into nearly every element of <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="47">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo’s" data-scaytid="48">Tengo&rsquo;s</span> sound, while also adding some orchestral touches to bring a more grandiose feeling to some tracks without sounding overbearing. But as good as the more noticeable elements of <span word="McEntire’s" data-scaytid="61">McEntire&rsquo;s</span> production are, its real success is in how it never steals the show from the trio, as each song feels more like an intimate session between three highly compatible people in an attempt to express the most honest of feelings held between two . This is most evidently seen on the album&#39;s final track, <em>Before We Run</em>, as the track&#39;s horn swells and strings certainly add a dramatic punch, but feel insignificant when standing up against such poignantly simple yet revealing lines like &ldquo;Hold me in your arms, be still, be there / I&rsquo;ll hold you in mine before we run.&rdquo; This goes to show the greatest and possibly most vital consistency seen within <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="55">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="56">Tengo</span>&nbsp;not just on this album, but throughout most of their career: No matter what approach the band takes, their music always maintains the intimacy of staring into a loved one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>There was a good chance that <strong>Fade</strong> may have been more aptly named than any of us would have hoped for, as it&rsquo;s not unimaginable for a band as long-running as <span word="Yo" data-scaytid="64">Yo</span> La <span word="Tengo" data-scaytid="65">Tengo</span> to finally lose their luster by album thirteen. Even when they&rsquo;re operating at their most wildly and unpredictable, it&rsquo;s still not entirely hard for seasoned fans of the group to know what they&rsquo;re getting into, and <strong>Fade</strong> is certainly no exception to this. But if anything, <strong>Fade</strong> is a sign of perseverance for the group, as the album perfectly details just what is so essential and appealing about the group, and why there will always be a place for these guys in the world of indie rock.</p>
